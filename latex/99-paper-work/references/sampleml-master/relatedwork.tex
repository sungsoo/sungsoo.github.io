\noindent \textbf{Data Cleaning and Databases: } 
When data cleaning is expensive, it is desirable to apply it \textbf{progressively}, where analysts can inspect early results with only $k \ll N$ records cleaned.
Progressive data cleaning is a well studied problem especially in the context of entity resolution \cite{altowim2014progressive, whang2014incremental, papenbrock2015progressive, gruenheid2014incremental}.
Prior work has focused the problem of designing data structures and algorithms to apply data cleaning progressively.
This is challenging because many data cleaning algorithms require information from entire relations, and designing incremental models is a challenging problem even for just entity resolution.
However, over the last 5 years a number of new results have expanded progressive data cleaning to rule based systems \cite{mayfield2010eracer, DBLP:journals/pvldb/YakoutENOI11, yakout2013don}.
\sys explores the statistical implications of using progressive data cleaning before high-dimensional predictive modeling.

Recently, in works such as SampleClean \cite{wang1999sample}, the application (i.e., queries) are used to inform data cleaning methodology.
It suffices to clean a sample of data when the data will be used to answer aggregate queries.
Sampling has also been applied to assess the number of duplicates in a relation \cite{heise2014estimating}.
When the workload is made up of aggregate queries, cleaning samples of data may suffice. 
Similarly, Bergman et al. explore the problem of query-oriented data cleaning \cite{DBLP:conf/sigmod/BergmanMNT15}. Given a query they clean data relevant to that query. 
Bergman et al. does not explore the Machine Learning applications studied in this work.
Deshpande et al. studied data acquisition in sensor networks \cite{deshpande2004model}. They explored value of information based prioritization of data acquisition for estimating aggregate queries of sensor readings.
Similarly, Jeffery et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/pervasive/JefferyAFHW06} explored similar prioritization based on value of information.
We see this work as pushing prioritization further down the pipeline to the end analytics.
Finally, incremental optimization methods like SGD have a connection to incremental materialized view maintenance as the argument for incremental maintenance over recomputation is similar (i.e., relatively sparse updates).
Krishnan et al. explored how samples of materialized views can be maintained similar to how models are updated with a sample of clean data in this work \cite{krishnan2015svc}

\noindent \textbf{Stochastic Optimization and Active Learning: } Zhao and Tong recently proposed using importance sampling in conjunction with stochastic gradient descent \cite{zhao2014stochastic}. 
The ideas applied in \sys are well rooted in the Machine Learning and Optimization literature, and we apply these ideas to the data cleaning problem. 
This line of work builds on prior results in linear algebra that show that some matrix columns are more informative than others \cite{drineas2012fast}, and Active Learning which shows that some labels are more informative that others \cite{settles2010active}.
Active Learning largely studies the problem of label acquisition \cite{settles2010active},
and recently the links between Active Learning and Stochastic optimization have been studied \cite{guillory2009active}. 
We use the work in Guillory et al. to evaluate a state-of-the-art Active Learning technique against \sys.

\noindent \textbf{Transfer Learning and Bias Mitigation: }  
\sys has a strong link to a field called Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation \cite{pan2010survey}. The basic idea of Transfer Learning is that suppose a model is trained on a dataset $D$ but tested on a dataset $D'$. 
Much of the complexity and contribution of \sys comes from efficiently tuning such a process for expensive data cleaning applications -- costs not studied in Transfer Learning.
In robotics, Mahler et al. explored a calibration problem in which data was systematically corrupted \cite{DBLP:conf/case/MahlerKLSMKPWFAG14} and proposed a rule-based technique for cleaning data.
Other problems in bias mitigation (e.g., Krishnan et al. \cite{DBLP:conf/recsys/KrishnanPFG14}) have the same structure, systematically corrupted data that is feeding into a model.
In this work, we try to generalize these principles given a general dirty dataset, convex model, and data cleaning procedure.

\noindent \textbf{Secure Learning: } \sys is also related to work in adversarial learning \cite{nelson2012query}, where the goal is to make models robust to adversarial data manipulation.
This line of work has extensively studied methodologies for making models private to external queries and robust to malicious labels \cite{xiaofeature}, but the data cleaning problem explores more general corruptions than just malicious labels.
One widely applied technique in this field is reject-on-negative impact, which essentially, discards data that reduces the loss function--which will not work when we do not have access to the true loss function (only the ``dirty loss").
