# IBM Hybrid Transaction Analytic Processing HTAP

Learn how customers are using HTAP to eliminate *analytic latency* and *data synchronization* issues to transform and simplify information management infrastructure. For years IT customers have been told that *online transaction processing* (OLTP) and analytics couldn’t co-exist on the same platform. This led to costly and complex regimes to move OLTP data to a different platform for analytics. With HTAP, the barriers to near real-time analytics are removed amid significant reductions in IT expenses and complexity risk.

The concept of **Hybrid Transaction/Analytic Processing** was coined by Gartner. IBM implements HTAP in two ways:

* IBM DB2 Analytics Accelerator (IDAA) for DB2 for z/OS data (using Netezza hardware)
* DB2 BLU Acceleration – DB2 for Linux, Unix, Windows (a software-only implementation)
