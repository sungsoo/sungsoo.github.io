# [Agentic GraphRAG: Simplifying Retrieval Across Structured & Unstructured Data — Zach Blumenfeld](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzM3cW6FdBs)



## Abstract

Agentic workflows often become complex, brittle, and hard to maintain when they need to retrieve and reason across both structured data (typically requiring precise query execution) and unstructured data (commonly handled via vector search in RAG). In this talk, we’ll explore how mapping key information into a knowledge graph can simplify these workflows and improve retrieval quality. You’ll learn core concepts behind GraphRAG, how to integrate it into agent tools, and get access to end-to-end code examples so you can start building right away.
