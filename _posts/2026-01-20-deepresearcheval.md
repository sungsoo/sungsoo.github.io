## Abstract
This paper introduces DeepResearchEval, an automated framework designed to benchmark deep research systems—AI agents capable of complex, multi-step web investigation and report generation. Addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks which often rely on static criteria and limited factual verification, the authors propose a two-part solution. First, a persona-driven task construction pipeline generates realistic, complex research queries filtered for search necessity. Second, an agentic evaluation pipeline employs "Adaptive Point-wise Quality Evaluation" to dynamically derive task-specific metrics and "Active Fact-Checking" to autonomously verify claims via live web search, even without citations. The framework evaluates 9 major systems (including Gemini 2.5-Pro, OpenAI Deep Research, and Manus), revealing significant performance gaps between general quality and task-specific requirements.

### Key Topics:

* Deep Research Systems
* Agentic Evaluation
* Automated Benchmarking
* Active Fact-Checking
* Task Construction
* Large Language Models
