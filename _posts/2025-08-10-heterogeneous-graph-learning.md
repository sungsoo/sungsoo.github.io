# [Heterogeneous graph learning [Advanced PyTorch Geometric Tutorial 4]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL09oshDKww)


## Abstract

* [https://antoniolonga.github.io/Advanced_PyG_tutorials/index.html](https://antoniolonga.github.io/Advanced_PyG_tutorials/index.html)

We have discussed Heterogeneous Graphs Learning. 
In particular, we show how Heterogeneous Graphs in Pytorch Geometric are loaded and their properties.

Finally, we show an example on a dataset.
