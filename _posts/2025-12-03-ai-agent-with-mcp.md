# [How to build an AI agent with MCP, ADK, and A2A on Google Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mQwHqK1I5w)

## Abstract

Explore the powerful tools and protocols for AI agent development on Google Cloud. In this video, we dive into how to connect AI models to resources using Model Context Protocol (MCP), streamline agent creation with the Agent Development Kit (ADK), and enable seamless communication between agents with the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol. By the end, you will have a working AI agent system, while understanding its underlying architecture.
