# Taking the I out of PaaS with Apache Mesos
 
The drive to continuous delivery, micro services and PaaS includes the need to auto scale and potentially auto provision services. This session will identify the legacy thinking of a statically partitioned world and drive to the scalable world of Apache Mesos.

This session will look at the failings of the many of today's cloud technology, identify the goals we have and look into the tooling of how to get there. In this session we will look at:

- *static* vs *elastic* partitioning
- vm vs containers
- separating cluster capacity from application scale
- load balancing with HAProxy
- This session will be packed with demonstrations.
