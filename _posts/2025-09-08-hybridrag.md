# [HybridRAG: A Fusion of Graph and Vector Retrieval - Mitesh Patel, NVIDIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlAIgmi_Vow)


## Abstract

Interpreting complex information from unstructured text data poses significant challenges to Large Language Models (LLM), with difficulties often arising from specialized terminology and the multifaceted relationships between entities in document architectures. Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) methods face limitations in capturing these nuanced interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. In our talk, we introduce a novel approach integrating Knowledge Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) with VectorRAG, designed to refine question-answering (Q&A) systems for more effective information extraction from complex texts. Our approach employs a dual retrieval strategy that harnesses both knowledge graphs and vector databases, enabling the generation of precise and contextually appropriate answers, thereby setting a new standard for LLMs in processing sophisticated data.
