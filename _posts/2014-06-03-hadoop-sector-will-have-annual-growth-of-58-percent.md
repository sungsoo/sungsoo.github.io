# Hadoop Sector will Have Annual Growth of 58% for 2013-2020 


[![hadoop logo square 300x300 Hadoop Sector will Have Annual Growth of
58% for 2013
2020](http://cloudtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hadoop-logo-square-300x300.jpg "Hadoop Sector will Have Annual Growth of 58% for 2013 2020")](http://cloudtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hadoop-logo-square.jpg) According
to a new report [published by Allied Market
Research](http://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/hadoop-market), the
worldwide market for Hadoop set to grow to $50.2 billion by 2020 from
$2.0 billion in 2013 with a CAGR of 58.2% between 2013 and 2020.

The research titled, “Hadoop Market (Hardware, Software, Services and
HaaS, End Use Application, and Geography)”, report that the Hadoop
market is driven by the exponential growth in the volume of unstructured
data from big data analysis and the ability to access data at high speed
with reduced costs compared to traditional RDBMSs. Hadoop not only
provides new features of data management and is able to manage
unstructured data, but also reduces costs with greater effectiveness.

The company’s analysts have segmented the market for hardware, software
and services. The services segment occupied half of the market in 2013
followed by the hardware. AWS, Hortonworks, Cloudera, Cisco Systems,
Datameer, MarkLogic, Teradata Corporation, Pentaho Corporation,
Karmasphere and MapR Technologies among others are the key players of
the Hadoop market.

The report categorized the [Hadoop software
market](http://cloudtimes.org/2014/01/24/hadoop-2-0-a-big-step-for-big-data-momentum/)
into application software, management software, packaged software and
performance monitoring software and found that application software
category is leading the global Hadoop software market due to high return
in its increasing implementation by developers to build real time
applications. Also, Hadoop packaged software provides easier deployment
of Hadoop clusters. Thus, Hadoop projects such as MapReduce, Sqoop, Hive
and others can be smoothly integrated.

The Hadoop hardware market is divided into servers, storage and network
equipment market, out of which, storage market generates the largest
revenue due to more data generation and increasing amount of storage
space.

Allied Market Research segmented the Hadoop sectors in manufacturing,
BFSI, government sector, retail, trade and transportation, IT and ITES,
media and entertainment, healthcare, hospitality and telecommunication.
Among the various application segments for Hadoop, [government sectors
are leading the
adoption](http://cloudtimes.org/2014/04/15/study-finds-big-data-is-the-driving-force-behind-growth-in-public-cloud-services/)
followed by healthcare and retail. In fact, the government sector has
access to a large volume of data, and must deal with management
problems. The telecommunications sector is going to take pace with
growing Hadoop.

At this time, however, the sector has to deal with some new challenges
such as lack of qualified and experienced staff that is able to
effectively manage the Hadoop architecture. It is a lack that is being
felt particularly in the software house engaged in the application area.
This is reflected in an inertia in the adoption of Hadoop especially in
small and medium enterprises. In addition, companies cannot rely solely
on the analyst, they also need solutions from the scope of BI, data
collection and transmission of operational information, etc.
