# Traffic Prediction

The Traffic Prediction feature of IBMÂ® Intelligent Operations for Transportation provides traffic prediction capabilities for transportation authorities. The Traffic Prediction feature uses the *historical* and *real-time* traffic data that is collected by the **Traffic Awareness system** to predict future traffic levels of a geographical area, up to an hour in advance.

Traffic Prediction is an optional feature that enhances the IBM Intelligent Transportation solution by providing the following benefits:

* Geographical visibility of predicted traffic levels at selected time intervals ahead of the current time *up to one hour ahead* of the current time. For example, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, or 60 minutes
* Listed view of details that are related to the predicted traffic levels at selected time intervals ahead of the current time, as selected with the Prediction interval slider. For example, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes
* Executive reports for traffic prediction that are based on *speed* and *volume*
* *Accuracy reports* analyzing traffic prediction data


The *Traffic Prediction predictive analytics* perform estimate and mean calculations that are required by the algorithm to generate near future traffic levels. Three months of historical traffic speed or volume data is required for the generation of future traffic levels.

The following table describes the detailed subsystems that are provided by the Traffic Prediction feature.
