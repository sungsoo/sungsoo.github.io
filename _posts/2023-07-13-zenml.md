# Tool Agnostic MLOps with ZenML


## Abstract

The MLOps landscape is exploding with new tools for specific needs. As an ML practitioner, it can be disorienting which tools to use, and even harder, how to do it in a production setting.

In this talk, Hamza shows how you can use ZenML to build tool-agnostic MLOps solutions tailored to your needs. He walks you through how you build an ML pipeline and experiment on your local machine, and scale the pipeline into a full-fledged production-ready solution with minimal code changes.
