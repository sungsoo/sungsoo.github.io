## Abstract

Can we build neural architectures that go beyond Transformers by leveraging principles from dynamical systems?
In this talk, we'll introduce a novel approach to sequence modeling that draws inspiration from the paradigm of online control of dynamical systems to achieve long-range memory, fast inference, and provable robustness.
