# [The Eigenvector of Multi Agent Systems w/ RAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVCG3NRetGQ)


## Abstract

EIGEN-1 is a highly efficient agentic framework that replaces explicit tool calls with an implicit, on-stream Monitor-Querier-Injector pipeline for tax-free RAG. 

It swaps democratic multi-agent aggregation for Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR), a structured protocol using rotating anchor-reference assignments for targeted, peer-informed solution repair. 

The process is governed by Quality-Aware Iterative Reasoning (QAIR), an adaptive control loop that uses quality-score thresholds to selectively refine weak solutions and ensure efficient convergence.
