## Abstract

Lewis Hammond serves as Research Director of the Cooperative AI Foundation and is a DPhil candidate in Computer Science at the University of Oxford. He is also affiliated with the Centre for the Governance of AI and is a 'Pathways to AI Policy' fellow at the Wilson Center. His research concerns safety and cooperation in multi-agent systems, motivated by the problem of ensuring that AI and other powerful technologies are developed and governed safely and democratically. Currently, his work focuses on strategic interactions between agents of different computational capabilities and has been funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, OpenAI, and the Long-Term Future Fund. Before coming to Oxford he obtained a BSc in mathematics and philosophy from the University of Warwick and an MSc in artificial intelligence from the University of Edinburgh.
