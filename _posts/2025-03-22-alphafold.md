## Abstract

Proteins exist as a dynamic ensemble of multiple conformations, and these motions are often crucial for their functions. However, current structure prediction methods predominantly yield a single conformation, overlooking the conformational heterogeneity revealed by diverse experimental modalities. Here, we present a framework for building experiment-grounded protein structure generative models that infer conformational ensembles consistent with measured experimental data. The key idea is to treat stateof-the-art protein structure predictors (e.g., AlphaFold3) as sequence-conditioned structural priors, and cast ensemble modeling as posterior inference of protein structures given experimental measurements. Through extensive real-data experiments, we demonstrate the generality of our method to incorporate a variety of experimental measurements. In particular, our framework uncovers previously unmodeled conformational heterogeneity from crystallographic densities, and generates high-accuracy NMR ensembles orders of magnitude faster than the status quo. Notably, we demonstrate that our ensembles outperform AlphaFold3 (Abramson et al., 2024) and sometimes better fit experimental data than publicly deposited structures to the Protein Data Bank (PDB, Burley et al. (2017)). We believe that this approach will unlock building predictive models that fully embrace experimentally observed conformational diversity.
