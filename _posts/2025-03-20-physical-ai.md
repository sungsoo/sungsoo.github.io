# Why Physical AI Will Arrive Before AGI?

## Abstract
At CES 2025, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the rapid advancements in "physical AI" compared to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Physical AI, focused on specific real-world tasks like robotics and autonomous navigation, is more achievable in the near term. Huang introduced NVIDIA Cosmos, a platform leveraging synthetic data to accelerate the training of robots and autonomous vehicles, emphasizing its potential to transform industries. While AGI seeks human-like cognition, physical AI offers pragmatic, immediate applications, making it a priority for development. Huang’s keynote underscored the practical advantages and industrial impact of physical AI in shaping the future before AGI arrives.
