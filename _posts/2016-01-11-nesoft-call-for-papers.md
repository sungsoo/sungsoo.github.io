## 2nd IEEE CONFERENCE ON NETWORK SOFTWARIZATION – NetSoft 2016

### Softwarization of Networks, Clouds, and Internet of Things

**SEOUL, KOREA**

**June 6-10, 2016**

## CALL FOR DEMONSTRATIONS

The IEEE conference on Network Softwarization, NetSoft 2016, invites
demonstration proposals on networking software related research
prototypes. As a high-profile, leading edge forum for researchers and
engineers in the field of networking software, Software Defined
Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV), NetSoft 2016
offers a unique opportunity to demonstrate innovative and leading edge
networking software prototypes, engage with highly skilled technical
audience, and discuss emerging technologies with key thought leaders.
Demonstrations showcasing working systems, innovative applications,
ground breaking ideas, and novel concepts related to networking software
are welcome. In particular, we are seeking the following types of
contributions without implying any order of preference:

-   Demonstrations from student authors related to the concepts
    presented in their paper(s)
-   Demonstrations from authors whose contributions have been accepted
    in the main conference and workshops
-   Demonstrations from faculty and academic research groups related to
    NetSoft 2016 key topics
-   Demonstrations from industrial researchers
-   Demonstrations from open source communities

 

## PAPER SUBMISSION

Prospective contributors are expected to turn in a demo proposal in the
form of a 2-page paper in IEEE conference double-column format,
preferably incorporating a demo system architecture illustration. Demo
papers will be peer-reviewed and accepted demo papers will be included
in the electronic conference/workshops proceedings bundle provided to
NetSoft 2016 attendees and will be subsequently submitted to IEEE
Xplore. The paper should incorporate the following:

-   Title
-   Abstract
-   Description
-   Key networking concepts involved and what is demonstrated
-   Prototype Illustrations
-   Highlights of the innovation, ground breaking, novel ideas in the
    area of Networking Software.
-   A crisp list of individual items that will be demonstrated.
-   The list of technical requirements for the demonstration (power
    outlet, space, etc.).

The proposal may include additional documents like power points, etc.,
that clarifies the demonstration. Demonstration proposal papers should
be submitted through electronic mail (E-mail) to
roberto.riggio@create-net.org, drsungwon@khu.ac.kr, and
kamiyama.noriaki@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp by April 29th, 2016.
