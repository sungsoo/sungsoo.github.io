# [How to get your ideas to spread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBIVlM435Zg)

Seth Godin, the world-renowned marketing and leadership author inspires us on how to get our ideas spread when mass marketing and traditional advertising have moved to the past. 

### Key points:

* Mass marketing and traditional advertising don’t work anymore.
* Everyone is a click away, which means that both opportunities, but also competition, are increasing.
* “People like us (do things like this)”  - the job of the marketer is to find the people like us and determine what do things like this really mean.
* The winners will be those who can find the right niche and lead them.

### Questions to consider:
* What is the niche customer segment your product or service is for?
* How can you reach and lead that group?
* How can you make your customers feel that you see and hear them?
