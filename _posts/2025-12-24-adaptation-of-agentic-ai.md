## Abstract

### Summary:
This survey paper introduces a unified framework for the adaptation of agentic AI systems, organizing the research landscape into four core paradigms based on the optimization target (agent vs. tool) and the supervision signal source (tool execution vs. agent output). It systematically compares agent adaptation (A1 & A2), which modifies the core model, against tool adaptation (T1 & T2), which optimizes external components like retrievers and subagents around a frozen model. The paper highlights the emerging "symbiotic inversion" of the T2 paradigm, where tools are trained to serve specific agents, offering superior modularity and data efficiency.

* Agentic AI
* Agent Adaptation
