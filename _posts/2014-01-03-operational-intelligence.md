### Real-time Operational Intelligence

Are your operators and technicians responding quickly enough to prevent problems?   
Are you *filtering* noise and providing the right information to operators to drive action? 

This webinar looks at best practices for improving operations using *Real-time Operational Intelligence* and mobility -- leveraging your existing automation systems and data.   

The goal is to drive the **right information**, to the **right person**, for the **right results**. 

In this one-hour webinar, GE shared proven strategies and apps to:

* *Drive the right information* & KPIs to the right person, based on location, moment, role, and real-time events 
* *Filter alarm noise* and guide response for increased uptime 
* *Collaborate* easily across team members 
* *Trigger* action to prevent problems before they even occur 
* *Ease regulatory compliance* by enforcing procedures

### The Essential Remote Monitoring And Diagnostic Center

**Big data** is good. If you can harness it.

For decades, technology has connected people and businesses globally. But, that was just the beginning. The Internet now can transform global businesses, joining human insight with *remote operations and equipment*. It does this with DATA.

Every minute, throughout your entire operation, you generate massive amounts of data.   
You do your best to *collect*, *store*, *analyze*, and *act* on it. You can turn it into *insight*—and even develop foresight from it—to empower your business strategy and execution.

#### The problem

Without a data-management structure, all your data can become *inaccessible*, *unmanageable*, and *uncorrelated*—and it even can sit idle.

Now is the time to prepare your enterprise for the "**Industrial Internet**" by building a proper data-management structure—so you can leverage the power of **Industrial Big Data**.

#### How GE Power & Water did it.

In this first webinar in a series, we'll focus on GE Power & Water, which has 60,000+ customers and thousands of assets in the field. This company will discuss why it needed to take control of its data—and how it built its data-management structure via a **Remote Monitoring & Diagnostics Center** (RM&D). 

This webinar will answer:

* How can an RM&D Center improve customer responsiveness?
* How can it move from "reactive" to "proactive?"
* How does an RM&D Center drive competitive advantage?
* How does it expand sales-revenue?
* Can an RM&D Center track performance and accuracy?
