# Future of big data analytics: machine data and connected vehicles


If you simply collecting a lot of data, you do not have a big data use
case. However you do have a big data use case, if you need to ***process
and analyze the collected data*** in order to generate greater business
value. A common example cited is that if you are storing millions of
records from your customers personal info in a database that is not a
big data use case. However if you are collecting web logs from millions
of hits to your site from online transactions, the that probably is.

For a long time, automotive industry was in the former category. Today
that seems to be changing and much media attention has been focused on
an area where big data and automobiles intersect: Vehicle to vehicle
(V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication to improve
safety and information. This is collectively referred to as machine to
machine or M2M communication. Some
[studies](http://www.advancedmobilityproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/telefonica_digital_connected_car_report_english.pdf "studies  ")seem
to indicate that by 2022 "*there will be 1.8 billion automotive M2M
connections. This will comprise 700 million Connected Cars and 1.1
billion aftermarket devices for services such as navigation, usage-based
insurance, stolen vehicle recovery (SVR) and infotainment*". The
[improvements in
safety](http://www.advancedmobilityproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/NHTSA-V2V-study-8-14.pdf "improvements in safety")
alone this will generate will be significant: from collision warnings to
blind spot checks to left turn assisting. While this is all great, much
of the infrastructure, policy regulation and standardization required to
make these things a reality does not exist today. That is one of the big
challenges.

The number of sensors constantly collecting data in a car has
continually increased from a handful in the 1980s to more than 1000
today. These sensors are capable of gathering typical mechanical and
electrical conditions data during the operation of a vehicle. But
nothing serious was done with this data and thus the data was typically
not stored. However automotive companies are now realizing that there is
actual value in this data stream and are beginning to take notice. This
can positively impact everything from maintenance and warranty costs to
recall to consumer insurance costs. The emergence of big data
technologies which enable cheap storage and affordable processing allow
automotive companies to generate significant value from data they would
normally ignore.

If we look at the three key data types that are driving adoption of big
data technologies such as Hadoop, they are (in order of decreasing
usage)

-   Clickstream and log data
-   Text data 
-   Geolocation data
-   Machine and sensor data

However this is very soon going to be inverted.  For example, GE pointed
out that industrial data is growing at twice the rate of other types of
data. For example, GE generates about 5 terabytes of data a day in its
labs. To address this, GE is building big data software called the
Historian that uses Hadoop to manage time-series data to help industrial
customers track their rising industrial data. They further estimate that
predictive maintenance and diagnostic applications alone can generate
about $130 Billion in value. Coupled with impacting supply chain
efficiency, this can be as high as $160B.

The point of this argument is that machine data is the low hanging fruit
of big data and analytics. The applications in manufacturing and
automotive areas themselves will soon dwarf today's dominant use cases.
The key for manufacturers is to get on this value train early and not
get left behind.
