# Urban Computing

## Abstract
Urban computing leverages data engineering/science, sensor-based technologies, mapping, and visualization techniques to tackle challenges cities have related to safety, road infrastructure, access to transportation, energy consumption, and traffic congestion. Learn more about Uber’s approach to urban computing and how a larger open source community effort could accelerate solutions that improve health, environment, and operations of cities.
