Data Curation as Publishing for the Digital Humanities
======================================================

“Publishing” has assumed a large role in discussions of how scholarship
is changing. One reason is that, in these discussions, the mechanisms of
publishing come to stand in for the larger and more complex processes of
creating, vetting, and circulating knowledge. Some of the sense of unmet
need that arises in considerations of the emerging, alternative
publishing methods for those working in digital humanities comes from
the problems with this shorthand.

Meeting the publishing needs of digital humanities scholars is
challenging not only because the outputs may take new forms—digital,
“database-driven,” or somehow online—but also because some of the
publishing that digital humanists want or need to do encompasses
processes of knowledge creation, dissemination, and exchange that
“publishing” does not encompass in its current forms. To put it another
way, if we are focused on outputs then we can probably accept
“publishing” as a shorthand for the larger processes of scholarship:
workflows, peer-review, marketing, production need to be adjusted
certainly for new forms but the framework of the conversation can remain
the same. Yet, if we [examine the work that humanists are
doing](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/421133 "Lorraine Daston "Whither Critical Inquiry?"")—in
something like the way that scholars in the field of Science and
Technology Studies
(STS) [have](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13124747 "Latour, Bruno, and Steve Woolgar. Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts.") [done](http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/36103882 "Galison, Peter. Image and Logic: a Material Culture of Microphysics.") for
science—by looking at their culture of material practices, then the
familiar framework of “publishing” does not serve us well. The interplay
of theory, data, and computational methods in a significant portion of
digital humanities scholarship works in such a way that to publish this
scholarship requires that we add some new dimensions to our ideas of
“publishing.”

I want to suggest that the theory and practice of data curation can
augment our notion of “publishing” in a way that will serve the needs of
the digital humanities community. The work of data curation—“active and
on-going management of data through its lifecycle of interest and
usefulness to scholarship, science, and education; … activities [which]
enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality, add value, and
provide for re-use over time” [(Cragin et al.
2007)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/3493 "Cragin, Melissa H et al. “An Educational Program on Data Curation.”") —should
be legible as “publishing” work for libraries and scholars to do in much
the same way that well-understood tasks related to preparing and
circulating monographs or journals are already legible as publishing
work. Moreover, I argue that articulating connections between
“publishing” and data curation is important in the context of strategic
decisions that libraries make about how to participate in “publishing.”
Data-curation-as-publishing is publishing work that draws directly on
the unique skills of librarians and aligns directly with library
missions and values in ways that other kinds of publishing endeavors may
not.
^[[1](#data-curation-as-publishing-for-the-digital-humanities-n-1)]^

The link between data curation and publishing is not wholly new. In
2009, Joyce Ray, Sayeed Choudhury, and Mike Furlough presented a paper
at the [Charleston
Conference](http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/charleston/ "Charleston Library Conference"),
summarizing several strands of contemporaneous work. The paper was
entitled [“Digital Curation and E-Publishing: Libraries Make the
Connection”](http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/charleston/2009/OutofBox/2/ "Choudhury, Sayeed, Mike Furlough, and Joyce Ray. “Digital Curation and E-Publishing: Libraries Make the Connection.”").
In this paper, Ray, Choudhury, and Furlough describe how data curation
and publishing can be mutually-reinforcing activities. They write:

> We have on the one hand, a community, or a subset of several
> communities, that has been working on the “back end” of digital
> production from the generation of raw data to the construction of an
> organized product that can be accessed, and, on the other hand,
> another community—publishers—who work on the “front end” of scholarly
> communications, from manuscripts to publication (Ray, Furlough,
> Choudhury 477).

Making the connection of the title involves bringing these communities
together as complementary elements of a service portfolio, staffing
model, and infrastructure that justifies the funding and the relevance
of libraries in a changing scholarly environment. This is a good
argument and some innovative libraries (among them Penn State, Johns
Hopkins, New York University, and Purdue) seem to be having some success
with this as a strategy. The main thrust of the argument that Ray,
Choudhury, and Furlough advance is managerial, bringing together
libraries and (university) publishers (under the aegis of the library)
as an attempt to rationalize the “business” that the combined
library/publisher is in. Treating data curation and publishing as
kindred services may offer the prospect of expanding a library’s stable
of “innovative” offerings while not straining resources because there
are management efficiencies in having both the “front end” and “back
end” people in the library. However, in this model, neither libraries
nor publishing seems truly transformed and this is a problematic
mismatch when so many other aspects of scholarly work are being
transformed.

I argue that it is possible, even preferable, to treat the connection
between data curation and publishing as more fundamental. As Ray,
Choudhury, and Ray themselves say: “Digital curation is a useful label
for that collection of challenges newly located at the intersection of
publishing, collections development, preservation, and the
humanities” (Ray, Furlough, Choudhury 479).

## Data Curation and Digital Humanities

As an enterprise, “digital humanities” (formerly “humanities computing”)
dates back [to the late
1940s](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-2-1 "Hockey, Susan. “The History of Humanities Computing.”") (debatably, [even
earlier](http://blogs.brandeis.edu/lts/2013/05/17/digital-humanities-from-1851/ "John Unsworth "Digital Humanities: From 1851?""))
and, since at least the 1980s, the curation of digital humanities
research data has been an associated area of research, activity, and
concern. Many of the early genres of digital humanities scholarship
re-enforced this connection between digital humanities scholarship and
data curation: “development of indices, annotated linguistic corpora,
and digitally encoded texts—in other words, the preparation, collection,
organization, and maintenance of datasets” (Palmer, Weber, Muñoz, and
Renear). For a fuller account see [Palmer, Weber, Muñoz, and Renear,
2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122190757/http:/www.archivejournal.net/issue/3/archives-remixed/foundations-of-data-curation-the-pedagogy-and-practice-of-purposeful-work-with-research-data/ ""Foundations of Data Curation: The Pedagogy and Practice of “Purposeful Work” with Research Data"").
In a piece for the *Chronicle of Higher Education* in 2002, Jerome
McGann predicted that “in the next 50 years, the entirety of our
inherited archive of cultural works will have to be re-edited within a
network of digital storage, access, and dissemination” (B7). Many have
taken McGann’s forecast as both a description of and a call to the work
of digital humanities. This vision of digital humanities contains clear
parallels with the goals of data curation practitioners and teachers
aiming “to build and maintain not only digital libraries and curated
data sets, but also the associated indexing systems, metadata standards,
ontologies, and retrieval systems” [(Palmer, Renear, and Cragin 2008
3)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/9764 "Purposeful Curation: Research and Education for a Future with Working Data"). The
point here is not that digital humanities and data curation have a
special affinity—there are long and rich histories of data curation in
the sciences and social sciences. My point is that data curation has
been part of the ambit of digital humanities for a long time and this
should guide us in thinking about how to publish digital humanities
work.

In referring to “data curation,” I am speaking specifically of
information work that integrates closely with the disciplinary practices
and needs of researchers in order to “maintain digital information that
is produced in the course of research in a manner that preserves its
meaning and usefulness as a potential input for further
research.” [(Munoz and Renear
2011)](http://hdl.handle.net/2142/30852 "Munoz and Renear, "Issues in Humanities Data Curation"") This
distinguishes data curation
from [many](http://guide.dhcuration.org/intro/ "Flanders and Munoz, "An Introduction to Humanities Data Curation"")[ near
synonyms](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122190757/http:/www.archivejournal.net/issue/3/archives-remixed/foundations-of-data-curation-the-pedagogy-and-practice-of-purposeful-work-with-research-data/ "Palmer, Weber, Munoz, Renear, "Foundations of Data Curation: The Pedagogy and Practice of “Purposeful Work” with Research Data""):
digital curation, digital stewardship, digital preservation. The
emergence of a specific discourse on “data curation” in the sciences
(with accompanying policy development, funding, and new research
interest) provides a framework for pulling together diffuse and
disparate activities in the humanities and describing these activities
under the new rubric.

Thus, digital humanists in particular are becoming increasingly aware of
data curation issues and data curation needs as part of the way they
(we) work. This element of digital humanities work is becoming prevalent
enough that I selected examples more or less at random from items that I
came across in my professional networks and social media feeds over the
period of a week in the spring of 2013. Lincoln Mullen, a PhD candidate
at Brandeis University, posted on his blog about [using the statistical
programming language R for historical
research](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134334/http:/lincolnmullen.com/blog/first-thoughts-on-using-r-as-a-historian/ "Lincoln Mullen, "Using R to Chart the Historical Demography of American Judaism"").
As part of his discussion, Mullen describes how he converted the tables
from a monograph he found in his research to a series of
comma-separated-values (CSV) files in order to produce graphs and charts
of the changing demographics of American religion. Along with his
analysis and the blog post about his methods, he [posted the (small)
data set to
Github](https://github.com/lmullen/demographics-religion "github link, "Data for the Historical Demographics of American Religion""),
a platform for sharing open source software code and open data. Ted
Underwood, Associate Professor of English at the University of Illinois,
has made the work he and a graduate assistant have done building,
cleaning, normalizing, and labeling a data set drawn from the HathiTrust
corpus a significant part of the output of his [“Uses of Scale”
project](http://usesofscale.com/ "Uses of Scale Home") and other
professional presentations. Kathleen Fitzpatrick has argued that
humanists “might … find our values shifting away from a sole focus on
the production of unique, original new arguments and texts to consider
instead curation as a valid form of scholarly activity” (Fitzpatrick
79). Fitzpatrick uses “curation” here as a near synonym of selection
after the manner of an gallery or museum curator selecting art for an
exhibition—a slightly different meaning than I have been developing. The
examples above of computational work with datasets draw in additional
meanings of curation related to information science.

It is also increasingly common to see the release of open data sets as
enticement to attract digital humanists to work on particular sets of
questions, or in partnership with cultural heritage organizations—see,
for example, the [IndexCat data from the National Library of
Medicine](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134213/http:/www.nlm.nih.gov/news/indexcat_data_xml.html ""NLM Releases Extensible Markup Language (XML) for IndexCat Data""),
a small collection of [catalog records for a historical library of
children’s
literature](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134138/http:/laurientaylor.org/2013/05/21/data-set-of-the-provisional-catalog-records-for-books-in-the-baldwin-library-of-historical-childrens-literature/ "Data Set of the Provisional Catalog Records for Books in the Baldwin Library of Historical Children’s Literature"),
data from some of [the crowdsourcing projects run by the New York Public
Library](http://menus.nypl.org/data "NYPL Data Projects"), [the
Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum collection
data](http://www.cooperhewitt.org/collections/data "Download Cooper-Hewitt Collections Data"),
and many more examples.

## Data Curation-as-Publishing

At least part of the professional activity of the digital humanists and
organizations above involves making data available and suitable for
re-use. As any of the researchers involved would no doubt say, curation
of these data sets takes time, effort, and money. Libraries getting
involved to help digital humanists do this kind of work would be
offering something of value. This would be “publishing” not only in the
sense of registering and “making public” a product of scholarly work,
but also in the sense of ensuring quality and disseminating outputs to
interested communities.
^[[2](#data-curation-as-publishing-for-the-digital-humanities-n-2)]^ By
recognizing data curation work as a publishing activity, libraries would
have a “market opportunity” to address unmet needs in the digital
humanities community (among others).

Distinguishing data-curation-as-publishing (a new and more-broadly
conceived activity suited to the kinds of knowledge production and
dissemination happening in digital humanities) from data as merely
another form of publication is a crucial point. In [a recent publication
in *Data Science
Journal*](http://dx.doi.org/10.2481/dsj.WDS-042 "Parsons, M. A., and P. A. Fox. “Is Data Publication the Right Metaphor?”"),
Mark Parsons and Peter Fox explore “data publication” as a metaphor for
the kind of things that scholarly communities want to see happen with
data. They explain that “Data Publication builds from the familiar and
conceptually simple model of scholarly literature publication” (WDS37)
and they capitalize the terms deliberately to indicate the status of
this phrase as “a recognized metaphor and data management paradigm”
(WDS33). Parson and Fox’s paper elaborates on what are some significant
problems in adopting this metaphor. In the limited space available I
want to focus on just one of these problems. Parsons and Fox note that
under the model of Data Publication “publishers are distributed and can
act autonomously or in concert” (WDS37). Thus, they write:

> there is … little emphasis on data discovery and interoperability
> across systems. Data are often presented as they were created without
> explicit considerations of data integration or significant reuse. …
> The attention is on preservation and formal recognized scholarly
> contribution with less attention to … issues such as latency, rapid
> versioning and reprocessing, and computational demands (WDS37).

To understand data-curation-as-publishing (which I’m advocating as a way
to serve digital humanities scholars) only as “Data Publication” expands
recognizable publisher and library activities to a new class of
scholarly objects (data) but in many ways perpetuates the (flawed)
status quo.

Within the critique of “Data Publication” there are glimpses of what it
could mean to treat the activities of data curation as “publishing”
activities in a way that would benefit both scholars and libraries. The
first part of Parson and Fox’s critique is that under the model of “Data
Publication” there is “little emphasis on data discovery and
interoperability across systems” (WDS37). Various examples from the
media landscape beyond scholarly publishing suggest the truth of this
claim. In the realm of ebooks, the importance of outlets like Amazon and
other digital dissemination channels has recently forced publishers to
pay greater attention to “discovery” and to devote more resources to
things like metadata. But at the same time, the fracturing and
proliferation of ebook reading platforms is an ongoing example of
problems of interoperability across systems in a publishing marketplace
(there is a similar shape to the story of the relative fortunes of the
on-demand video company [Netflix](http://netflix.com "Netflix Home") and
various real or rumored video platforms implemented by specific studios
or content creators). This leads to the question of whether lack of
emphasis on discovery and interoperability are intrinsic to the business
of publishing (presumably because the energies of publishers are
directed elsewhere to activities considered more vital to mission and
survival)? Attention to “discovery” and related issues of
interoperability across systems are traditional and persistent features
of library work.

This is where Ray, Choudhury, and Furlough see opportunity for libraries
who can “make the connection” between publishing and data curation—to
excel where traditional publishers have not—by having both “back end”
(librarian) and “front end” (publisher) organizational capacity. In
their discussion of “back end” and “front end,” these authors map the
organizational rationalization of connecting data curation and
publishing as library activities onto existing [lifecycle models of
data](https://web.archive.org/web/20131123120537/http:/www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model "DCC Curation Lifecycle Model") (this
is explicit in the paper) and onto an extended lifecycle model for
scholarly publications (in the example they give, journals and
monographs) that encompasses both distribution and long-term
preservation. “Putting a standard monograph series online didn’t make
the Library a publisher,” they write, “but it linked the Library’s role
as a preservation agent more directly to its emerging role as a
distributor” (Ray, Choudhury, and Furlough 480).

Yet, for as much as these early sketches of programs (for which the
authors deserve credit as pioneers in making any such moves in this
direction) emphasize the interdependence and mutual reinforcement of
curation and publishing, this vision of scholarly work with data is
still somewhat disappointingly static and familiar. Publishers add value
to end products through peer review and high quality production and
presentation. Libraries standardize and preserve these outputs and
continue to make them available to a community over time. Organizations
which comprise both library and publisher can imagine this as a unified
suite of services that cover the entire data lifecycle. However, if Data
Publication, rather than data curation is the governing metaphor, this
alignment, just having both “back end” and “front end” of the process,
may not be sufficient to avoid falling into traps such as neglecting
discovery and interoperability of digital humanities work with data. It
is worth noting, too, that a Data Publication model does not easily
encompass “issues such as latency, rapid versioning and reprocessing,
and computational demands” that resemble precisely the kinds of demands
that digital humanists are likely to make. (Parsons and Fox WDS37).

This leads to the next part of Parsons’s and Fox’s critique—under a
model of Data Publication, “data are often presented as they were
created without explicit considerations of data integration or
significant reuse.” (WDS37)  Data “presented as they were created”
sounds like a description of researcher self-deposit into
(institutional) data repositories—currently the most common form of
library engagement with data curation and embedded in both the Johns
Hopkins and Penn State models. Libraries cannot adopt a position of
becoming data publishers (via repository provision) in the way some are
seeking to become journal publishers through the provision of platforms
like Digital Commons and similar initiatives. That Parsons and Fox
single this problem out in a discussion of why Data Publication is a
problematic metaphor from the perspective of solving the real
information needs of researchers suggests that while the provision of
institutional data repositories is necessary and important it is not
sufficient to “purposeful work” with data. So, libraries cannot stand
pat; they cannot maintain only the “back end” of these processes but
must make the connection to more active engagement.

Ray, Choudhury, and Furlough present a fully-developed model of [the
data
lifecycle](https://web.archive.org/web/20131123120537/http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/curation-lifecycle-model "DCC Curation Lifecycle Model")
(developed by the UK Digital Curation Centre) but offer only a loose
schematic of a publishing lifecycle. To suggest how
data-curation-as-publishing may help expand the notion of “publishing”
in a way that would allow libraries to break out of their traditional
role at the “back end,” I would add another model to the discussion.
Historian Robert Darnton proposed a model of what he-called “the
communication circuit” in a seminal paper from 1982 entitled, [“What is
the History of
Books?”](http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:3403038 "Robert Darnton, "What is the History of Books?"").
Darnton’s model has been critiqued and elaborated by other book
historians (including Darnton himself) since the first publication but
the original version will suffice to advance the argument about data
curation and publishing. What is salutary about Darnton’s model and what
makes it an interesting partner for data lifecycle models is that it
includes, in addition to authors and publishers, printers, shippers,
booksellers and readers as part of the scope for understanding books as
texts and objects.

Part of the unique contribution of book history as “an
interdisciplinarity run riot” has been to reveal the agency of those who
package, categorize, organize, disseminate, receive, re-use, and
interpret in the co-creation of meaning and knowledge (Darnton 67). I am
not convinced that Ray, Choudhury, and Furlough’s merged organization
capable of both “front end” and “back end” work is sufficient to cover
the stations of this richer model. I believe libraries should treat data
curation activities as “publishing”—worthy of new enthusiasm and new
resources—but they (we) should be wary of framing the endeavor as “data
publishing” (an analog to journal and monograph publishing). By taking
“publishing” as a category to be re-imagined rather than a pre-existing
workflow to stepped into, libraries can and should take a more active
role in work with data—this is data curation-as-publishing.

## Developing Capacity for Data Curation-as-Publishing in Libraries

What form might this actually take? To offer a specific example from
digital humanities, data-curation-as-publishing might look something
like the Alexandria Archive Institute’s [Open Context
project](http://opencontext.org/ "Open Context Project Home"). Open
Context provides review, documentation, and publication of research
data, mostly in the discipline of archaeology. The “About” page of the
project web site speaks of “data sharing as publication” and a flavor of
the work the project carries out can be gleaned from a representative
sample of the [editors’
blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134034/http:/ux.opencontext.org/blog/2013/02/26/decoding-data-a-view-from-the-trenches/ "Decoding Data- A View from the Trenches"),
which discusses matching date files with code books, cross-checking
values, annotating, and describing the data set. The editors
[remark](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122134034/http:/ux.opencontext.org/blog/2013/02/26/decoding-data-a-view-from-the-trenches/ "Editors' Blog: Decoding Data- A View from the Trenches")
that “data sharing requires similar levels of effort and professionalism
as other more conventional forms of publication.” Open Context is hosted
and administered by the non-profit Alexandria Archive Institute and thus
represents a kind of freestanding example of an organization doing
data-curation-as-publishing. What would it mean to locate this effort in
libraries?

This question recalls a point that Choudhury, Furlough, and Ray make in
passing. In describing the creation of the Data Conservancy architecture
and service at Johns Hopkins, they write: “It is especially important to
note the role of a particular individual at AAS who acted as the human
‘interface’ between the various players. This individual could easily be
classified as a ‘data scientist’ – an individual with knowledge of a
specific domain or discipline yet also a deep knowledge of data
management” (479). They go on to remark that “libraries would be wise to
consider developing such expertise and capacity in-house” (479). I
contend that Open Context, and its editors, represent another example of
this kind and that libraries should be figuring how to set up and host
such activities. Developing the capacity to partner in this more broadly
conceived version of publishing that digital humanities and other data
intensive disciplines increasingly need will require libraries to alter
how they relate to collections.

At the [University of Maryland
Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/data "University of Maryland Research Data Services"),
those working on data curation are beginning to work on the question of
how to make a case to subject selectors (who control collection budgets
to support various disciplines) to spend collection funds on curation
work for significant data sets. These discussions are still at early
stages—there is lots to figure out including what specifically should
appear on “the invoices” for such data curation work that selectors are
being asked to pay—but libraries who wish to engage seriously with
support for data-intensive research (like the digital humanities) will
increasingly need to sell and buy such services. These funds will need
to come from collections (because that is still where the bulk of the
budgets reside) and accomplishing this shift will entail [breaking up
many of the present economic
“realities”](https://web.archive.org/web/20131125125448/http:/www.insidehighered.com/blogs/library-babel-fish/when-not-saying-no-negligence "Barbara Fisher, "When Not Saying 'No' Is Negligence"") that
shape libraries’ collection development.

I am not envisioning allocating funds to buy datasets—perhaps from a
vendor or platform that makes them available. The valuable work, the
work that libraries should own, is the type of activity like those the
editors of Open Context perform. The current situation in which
libraries purchase subscriptions to large databases of, for example,
journal articles, represents not only an unsustainable economic
situation but also an unsustainable professional one in which libraries
outsource the expertise and experience of collecting, normalizing,
organizing, and making available scholarly information. Librarians
should spend more time on creating metadata, building catalogs,
developing and refining indexes, and building, organizing, and
maintaining collections than on negotiating publisher contracts or
teaching the details of interfaces created by vendors. Extending
library, archive, and information science practices for data may include
aggregating data sets, cleaning and normalizing values, and annotating
data with controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The issues of
description, organization, and access for data are still largely
unsolved and libraries should demonstrate their expertise in solving
these challenges through developing and sustaining data
curation-as-publishing programs.

## Data Curation-as-Publishing Aligns with Library Missions and Values

There is a clear need for data curation work. Perhaps this should be its
own strategic initiative for libraries to pursue in parallel with
“publishing” initiatives? (This is in fact what many libraries are
doing.) Yet, with the financial support for libraries in flux, how many
strategic initiatives can libraries count on and expect to do well? Data
curation activities are fully legible as “publishing”—meeting the same
ends and goals and potentially contributing to scholarship in the same
kinds of ways. Also “library publishing” is a site of buzz and activity
and potential investment—partly, as I have argued, because the processes
and products of publishing stand in for “scholarship” writ large. I
would argue that if libraries are going to invest resources in
“publishing,” then that money should be spent partly on doing data
curation work because data curation-as-publishing offers the most value
to both researchers *and* libraries.

Data curation-as-publishing is the right form of publishing for
libraries to be in because the work of data curation aligns with
libraries’ missions and values in ways that other kinds of publishing
ventures do not. There is much about scholarly “publishing” as it exists
now that is not about making knowledge public or ensuring quality *of
that knowledge* or disseminating it to those who need and could use it.
There is a great deal of “publishing” that is about issues of prestige,
labor, and equity of the disciplinary professions. In my opinion,
libraries don’t really have a dog in that fight and shouldn’t spend
resources trying to fix those problems.

In a recent paper in the library and information science literature on
assessing data value, [Carole Palmer, Nic Weber, and Melissa
Cragin](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/meet.2011.14504801174 "Palmer, Carole L., Nicholas M. Weber, and Melissa H. Cragin. “The Analytic Potential of Scientific Data: Understanding Re-use Value.”")
remind us that “the library and information science meta-science
perspective articulated by [Marcia] Bates has always been fundamental to
the role of providing broad, useable information collections and
services, especially to support interdisciplinary research” (1999).
Doing data curation work (like that described above) needs the unique
training and skills of librarians and other information professionals
and it supports the goals and values of the profession in making
information accessible and usable to communities of users who need it.
Making data curation fully legible as publishing, and investing in data
curation-as-publishing, can help make problems of data discovery,
interoperability, and re-use less daunting and show a clear way for the
library to be a publisher in ways that research communities like digital
humanities need.

    Annual
    Conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122122622/http:/www.cic.net/calendar/conferences/library/2013/program "CIC Annual Conference"),
    May 22–23, 2013. The theme of the conference was “alt.pub.edu:
    Emerging Options for Scholarly Publishing” and I was delighted to be
    part of a panel with Matt Gold (CUNY) and Matthew Jockers (Nebraska)
    on “Digital Humanities, Alternative Publishing Needs of Faculty.” I
    have made additional revisions for publication in JDH. My thanks
    again to all the staff of the [CIC Center for Library
    Initiatives](http://www.cic.net/projects/library/home "CIC Center for Library Initiatives") and
    to the members of the Program Committee for the 2013 Annual
    Conference for inviting me to speak.
