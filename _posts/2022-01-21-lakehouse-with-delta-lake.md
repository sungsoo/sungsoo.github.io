# Lakehouse with Delta Lake Deep Dive Training

## Abstract
In this course, we will provide a brief overview of data architecture concepts, an introduction to the Lakehouse paradigm, and an in-depth look at Delta Lake features and functionality. You will learn about applying software engineering principles with Databricks as we demonstrate how to build end-to-end OLAP data pipelines using Delta Lake for batch and streaming data. The course also discusses serving data to end users through aggregate tables and Databricks SQL Analytics. Throughout the course, emphasis will be placed on using data engineering best practices with Databricks.

By the end of the course, students will understand how to apply data engineering best practices within Databricks.

### Prerequisites

* Familiarity with data engineering concepts
* Basic knowledge of Delta Lake core features and use cases
