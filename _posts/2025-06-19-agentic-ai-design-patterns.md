# [Agentic AI Design Patterns Introduction and walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrD9tCNpOvU)

## Abstract

The video explores four foundational design patterns in agentic AI systems: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration. These patterns represent the evolution of AI from basic problem-solving to sophisticated autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions with minimal human oversight. Through practical examples using Amazon Bedrock, the video demonstrates how AI agents can self-evaluate, utilize external tools, break down complex tasks, and collaborate effectively. The presentation emphasizes how these patterns enable AI systems to work independently and cooperatively while adapting to various challenges, ultimately transforming traditional work processes and industry operations through enhanced decision-making capabilities.
