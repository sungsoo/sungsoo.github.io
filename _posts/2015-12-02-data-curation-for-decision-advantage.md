# Machine Driven, Human Guided Data Curation for Decision Advantage and Action

During this one-hour web seminar, Oren Falkowitz, Co-Founder & CEO at Area 1 Security, discusses how data curation tools can be used to create a unified view of disparate data to assist with data integration.

As a security and data industry veteran, Mr. Falkowitz knows first-hand how organizations are attempting to leverage increasing amounts of disparate data sources to make decisions. As a result, they will need modern tools that help can automate the process. In this web seminar, you will hear how any organization – from government agencies to information services firms – can perform complex data integration tasks on semi-structured data with significant improvements in both speed and accuracy compared to traditional manual data integration.

What would you do if you had a unified view of your data?

We all struggle with integrating and curating the vast number of data sources available. With the tools on hand and manual processes we rely on, it takes most of our time just to identify sources and then prep them for analysis. Instead of thinking up and testing great ideas, we’re tracking down admin passwords and writing Python scripts. But now there is a better way.

## Webinar Agenda

At the webinar:

Oren discusses the challenges related to connecting large numbers of disparate data sources, the limitations of current tools and processes, and how Tamr can assist in the process of integrating semi-structured data
See a hands-on live technical demo where Alan Wagner of Tamr, walks you though the solution, showing you how Tamr’s unique combination of machine learning and expert sourcing overcomes the long-standing issues around data integration and curation.
Nidhi facilitates a Q&A session.
