# [Waymo: The future of autonomous driving with Vincent Vanhoucke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2t2pMtJGv6k)

## Abstract

How do you train an AI to drive safer than a human? Professor Hannah Fry sits down with Waymo Distinguished Engineer Vincent Vanhoucke to break down the complexities of autonomous driving—from the "closed loop" problem of real-world traffic to using generative AI for simulation. Plus, Hannah moves from theory to practice, taking a Waymo for a spin in California to experience it firsthand.
