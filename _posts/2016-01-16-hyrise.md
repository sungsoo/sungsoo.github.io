# HYRISE

In-Memory Hybrid Storage Engine
-------------------------------

![](http://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/plattner/projects/HYRISE/hyrise.png)

Traditional databases are separated into ones for current data from the
day-to-day business processes and ones for reporting and analytics. For
fast moving businesses, moving data from one silo to another is
cumbersome and takes too much time. As a result, the new data arriving
in the reporting system is already old by the time it is loaded. HYRISE
proposes a new way to solve this problem: It analyzes the query input
and reorganizes the stored data in different dimensions.  In detail,
HYRISE partitions the layout of the underlying tables in a vertical and
horizontal manner depending on the input to this layout management
component. The workload is specified as a set of queries and weights and
is processed by calculating the layout dependent costs for those
queries. Based on our cost-model we can now calculate the best set of
partitions for this input workload. This optimization allows great speed
improvements compared to traditional storage models. For details, please
refer to our PVLDB publications “HYRISE - A Main Memory Hybrid Storage
Engine” (VLDB'11) and “Fast Updates on Read-Optimized Databases Using
Multi-Core CPUs” (VLDB’12).

HYRISE-NV
---------

HYRISE-NV is a database storage engine that completely maintains table
and index structures on NVRAM. Our architecture updates the database
state and index structures transactionally consistent on NVRAM using
*multi-version* data structures, allowing to instantly recover databases
independent of their size. For index structures, we use multi-versioned
b-trees and adapted hashmaps to provide failure-atomic updates on NVM.
We evaluated HYRISE-NV on DRAM and with a hardware-based emulation of
NVM against the TPC-C benchmark. HYRISE-NV recovers databases
independent of their size, allowing the recovery of a table with 10
million rows in less than 100ms. Comparing HYRISE NV with a traditional
log-based approach, we report reduced transaction latencies as we can
refrain from batching transactions.

HYRISE-R - Lazy Master Replication for Enterprise Applications
--------------------------------------------------------------

HYRISE-R is a lazy master replication system for the in-memory
database HYRISE  By setting up a snapshot-based HYRISE cluster, we can
show an increase in both performance by distributing queries over
multiple instances and availability by utilizing the redundancy of the
cluster structure.

Dynamic Data Tiering
--------------------

With the recent rise of new storage tiers as PCIe-connected Phase Change
Memory cards and NVRAM as well as new partitioning schemes as
Actual/Historical Partitioning, this project revisits in-memory storage
formats. This includes, e.g., horizontal per-column partitioning to
differentiate between columns often accessed by analytical queries and
columns solely accessed by transactional queries as well as a hybrid
storage format, which improves tuple materialization from secondary
storage. Focussing on mixed workloads, less relevant data is put on
secondary storage tiers without jeopardizing the original performance
superiority of in-memory databases. Those new storage formats are both
applicable to an Actual/Historical partitioning as well as a more
general partitioning scheme.
