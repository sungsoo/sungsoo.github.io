*Big Data analytics* is estimated to save over $450B in healthcare costs, and there is exciting adoption of big data platforms with healthcare payers and providers. Hadoop and cloud computing have emerged as one of the most promising technologies for implementing big data at scale for healthcare workloads in production, using Hadoop as a service. 

Common considerations in the healthcare industry include privacy and data security, and the challenges of regulatory compliance with HIPAA and HITECH. Intel provides a security framework for Hadoop that enables enterprises to deploy big data analytics without compromising performance or security. Intel is contributing to a common security framework for Apache Hadoop, in the form of Project Rhino, which enables Hadoop to run workloads without compromising performance or security. Watch this session to learn how your enterprise can take advantage of the security capabilities in the Intel Data Platform running on AWS to analyze healthcare data while ensuring technical safeguards that help you remain in compliance.
