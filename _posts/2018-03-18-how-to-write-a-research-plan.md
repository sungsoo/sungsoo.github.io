# How to Write a Research Plan

If you’re a researcher, how you write your research plan will be entirely up to you. But for beginners, here are some tips which might be useful when writing your research plan:

* **Identify the purpose of your research plan.** You just need to answer the question: *What do I want to achieve in creating a research plan?*
* **Plan the strategies of attaining your goals.** *What do researchers usually do in a research?* List the things you need to do in order for your research to be successful. Find the best strategies to fit your research plan.
* **Organize your strategies.** Create an outline of the things you want to do. Create a *timeline* and allocate *enough time* for each strategy to be done.
* **Keep it specific.** Only include things that are related to the simple business plan. Do not include unnecessary ones which may just cause you confusion.
* **Keep it concise.** You need to keep your plan as *concise* as you can. Sure you might need a few pages, but maybe not more than three.
* **Be realistic.** Do not include unrealistic expectations and desired outcomes. *Keep your feet on the ground.*
* **Revise and improve your plan.** You don’t need to do much—just check for errors and maybe things to add, and you’re done!
