South Korea's constitutional court has unanimously voted to uphold the impeachment of president Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived declaration of martial law last December, which plunged the country into political turmoil.

Yoon's powers were first suspended when parliament voted to impeach him on 14 December.

Now that the impeachment is finalised, a snap election must be held in the country within 60 days.

Meanwhile, Yoon also faces a separate charge of insurrection which will go on trial at a later date.
