# [Causal Knowledge Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGq8wJMQRgY)

## Abstract

* Jeff Dagliesh
* VP of Product at Geminos 

Can we improve machines ability to reason by merging traditional knowledge graphs with causal graphs?

Jeff and his team are out to answer this question, using Grakn. In this talk, Jeff will set out to cover:

* What is a domain knowledge graph?
* What is a causal graph?
* Why it is important to use both causal graphs and domain knowledge graph when building reasoning systems.
* How we are building a tool in node-red that will allow modellers to model knowledge graphs and causal graphs and the output of the model will be Grakn schema (GQL)
