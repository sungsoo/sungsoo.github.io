# Large Language Models in 2025 – How Much Understanding and Intelligence?


The Stanford Open Virtual Assistant Lab, with sponsorship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Stanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI), organized an invitation-only workshop focused on the concept of a public AI assistant to worldwide knowledge and its implications for the future of the free web.

Language Models have been around for decades but took the world by storm in 2022 and are now frequently seen as synonymous with artificial intelligence in the popular media. What can people do with these models? How good are they at understanding and generating human language (historically the main task of the field of Natural Language Processing)? Are these models intelligent and are we on the verge of a new era of artificial super intelligence, as some prominent public voices claim?

## Speaker:
Christopher Manning - Thomas M. Siebel Professor of Machine Learning, Professor of Linguistics and Computer Science, and Senior Fellow at the Stanford Institute for HAI

This workshop was recorded on February 13, 2025 at Stanford University.
