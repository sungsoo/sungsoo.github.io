A **sequence diagram** is an interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order. It is a construct of a *Message Sequence Chart*. A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario. Sequence diagrams are typically associated with use case realizations in the Logical View of the system under development. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called **event diagrams**, **event scenarios**.

A sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (lifelines), different processes or objects that live simultaneously, and, as horizontal arrows, the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.

### Diagram Building Blocks
If the *lifeline* is that of an object, it demonstrates a *role*. Note that leaving the instance name blank can represent *anonymous* and *unnamed instances*.

**Messages**, written with horizontal arrows with the message name written above them, display interaction. Solid arrow heads represent synchronous calls, open arrow heads represent *asynchronous messages*, and dashed lines represent *reply messages*. If a caller sends a *synchronous* message, it must wait until the message is done, such as invoking a subroutine. If a caller sends an *asynchronous* message, it can continue processing and doesnâ€™t have to wait for a response. 

*Asynchronous calls* are present in multithreaded applications and in message-oriented middleware. Activation boxes, or method-call boxes, are opaque rectangles drawn on top of lifelines to represent that processes are being performed in response to the message (ExecutionSpecifications in UML).

**Objects** calling methods on themselves use messages and add new activation boxes on top of any others to indicate a further level of processing.

When an object is *destroyed* (removed from memory), an **X** is drawn on top of the lifeline, and the dashed line ceases to be drawn below it (this is not the case in the first example though). It should be the result of a message, either from the object itself, or another.

A message sent from *outside* the diagram can be represented by a message originating from a **filled-in circle** (found message in UML) or from a border of the sequence diagram (gate in UML).

UML 2 has introduced significant improvements to the capabilities of sequence diagrams. Most of these improvements are based on the idea of *interaction fragments* which represent smaller pieces of an enclosing interaction. Multiple interaction fragments are combined to create a variety of *combined fragments*, which are then used to model interactions that include **parallelism**, **conditional branches**, **optional interactions**.
