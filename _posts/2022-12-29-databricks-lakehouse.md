## Data Lakehouse and Data Meshâ€”Two Sides of the Same Coin

Over the last few years two new approaches to data management have been developed in the data community: Data Mesh and Data Lakehouse. The latter is an open architecture that pushes the technological advancements of a Data Lake by adding data management capabilities proven by a long history of Data Warehousing practices.
Data Mesh on the other hand is addressing data management challenges from an organizational angle, by advocating decentralized ownership of domain data while applying product thinking and domain-driven design to analytics data. At first one might think that those two architectural approaches are competing with each other, however in this talk you will learn that the two are rather orthogonal and can go very well together.
