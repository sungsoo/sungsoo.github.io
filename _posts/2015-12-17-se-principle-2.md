# Principle 2: Quality is in the eyes of the beholder

There is no one definition of software quality. To *developers*, it might be an elegant *design* or elegant *code*. To *users* who work in stress environments, it might be *response time* or *high capacity*.
For cost-sensitive projects, it might be low development cost. For some customers, it might be satisfying all their perceived and not-yet-perceived needs.
The dilemma is that these may *not be all compatible*.
Optimizing one person's quality might be detrimintal to another's. (This is Weinberg's "**Political Dilemma**" principle.) A project must decide on its *priorities* and articulate them to all parties.
