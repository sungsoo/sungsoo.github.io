Boxplots comparing two different populations
--

A common scenario in research is trying to determine whether two groups systematically differ on some characteristic. We can simulate this situation by generating normally *distributed random variates* for imaginary groups 1 and 2. In fact there is a difference: group 2 has a higher mean of 105 compared to 95. Parallel boxplots are a good way of showing the distribution of scores across the two groups.

```python
import pylab
import random

popSize = 100
category1 = []
category2 = []

## Start by generating scores for category 1 individuals
## Their mean score is 95
for i in range(popSize):
    category1.append(random.normalvariate(95,10))

## Now generate scores for category 2 individuals
## They have a higher mean of 105
for i in range(popSize):
    category2.append(random.normalvariate(105,10))

scores = [category1,category2]

pylab.boxplot(scores)
pylab.savefig('boxplots.png')
pylab.show()
```

Line graphs
--

To show how to plot a line graph in Python, we can generate a *fictional time series*. Imagine a 100-day time span, and that the price of some commodity tends to increase by about 0.2 units per day.

![](http://sungsoo.github.com/images/lineGraph.png)

```python
import pylab
import random

duration = 100
meanIncrease = 0.2
stDevIncrease = 1.2

## Here we generate a fictional time series, for a
## variable that generally increases over time but
## has significant noise.

x = range(duration)
y = []
yNow = 0

for i in x:
    nextDelta = random.normalvariate(meanIncrease,stDevIncrease)
    yNow += nextDelta
    y.append(yNow)

pylab.plot(x,y)
pylab.xlabel("Time")
pylab.ylabel("Value")
pylab.savefig("lineGraph.png")
pylab.show()
