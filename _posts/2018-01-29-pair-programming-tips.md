## Pair Programming Tips: Paring Tips 

* Pair on everything you'll need to maintain.
* Allow pairs to form *fluidly* rather than assigning partners.
* Switch partners when you need a *fresh perspective*.
* *Avoid pairing with the same person* for more than a day at a time.
* Sit comfortably, side by side.
* Produce code through conversation. *Collaborate*, don't critique.
* Switch *driver* and *navigator* roles frequently.
