# No Such Thing As Artificial Intelligence 

What is happening with the *neural networks* in this video? You'll find the answers in these videos:

1. [How Does Deep Learning Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He4t7Zekob0&index=5&list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2) 

2. [Overfitting and Regularization For Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aF9sJrzxaM&index=18&list=PLujxSBD-JXglGL3ERdDOhthD3jTlfudC2)

In this episode, we discuss the perils of debating whether different existing techniques can be deemed artificial intelligence or not.
