## Abstract
The U.S. Department of Energy’s national labs and OpenAI convened the first 1,000 Scientist AI Jam Session on Feb. 28, 2025 to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can accelerate scientific discovery. 

Nine national labs—Argonne, Berkeley, Brookhaven, Idaho, Livermore, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Pacific Northwest, and Princeton Plasma Physics— hosted more than 1,500 of America’s leading scientists for the day-long event. Participants had access to leading frontier AI models to test research applications, explore model responses, and share feedback to improve future AI systems. 

This virtual conversation shared more details about how AI has the potential to dramatically accelerate the pace of scientific work to strengthen America’s leadership in AI and innovation.  

### Participants include:
* Alex Carney, Senior Researcher, OpenAI 
* Rick L. Stevens, Associate Laboratory Director, Argonne National Laboratory 
* Brian Spears, Director of the AI Innovation Incubator, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
* Court Corley, Chief Scientist for Artificial Intelligence, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory
* Prasanna Balaprakash, Director of AI Programs, Oak Ridge National Laboratory
