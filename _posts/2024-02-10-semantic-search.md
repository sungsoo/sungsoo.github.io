# Document Semantic Search with Vector Databases


## Abstract

Join our very first interactive livestream where we will go over an essential vector database use case: document semantic search. In the session, we'll walk you through a hands-on exercise demonstrating querying text data by "meaning" rather than keywords. 

Feel free to simply watch along, or even participate yourself by setting up your own free KDB.AI vector database ahead of the session at https://kdb.ai

This introductory session will give you a solid understanding of how vector databases work, the increased relevance of search results, and the potential applications you can build on top of them. Hope to see you there!
