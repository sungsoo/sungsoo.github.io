# [How To Get The Most Out Of Vibe Coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJjsfNO5JTo)


## Abstract

AI can't yet one-shot an entire productâ€”but with the rise of vibe coding, it's getting close.  

YC's Tom Blomfield has spent the last month building side projects with tools like Claude Code, Windsurf, and Aqua, seeing just how far you can push modern LLMs. From writing full-stack apps to debugging with a single paste of an error message, AI is becoming a legit collaborator in the dev process. This video is a playbook for anyone who wants to get the most out of vibe coding and build faster.
