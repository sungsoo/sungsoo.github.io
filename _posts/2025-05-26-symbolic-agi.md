## Abstract

True AGI will combine formal and informal methods.  People are already combining these tools in this way.  M-x Jarvis in our time, but evolving Open Source is critical to delivering real value.

This video is part of Positron's efforts to make a case for open innovation.  You can show support for this effort on Positron's Github Sponsors page

1. Empirical argument that induction must be capable of emerging deductive and formal systems.
2. Decoding to a less restricted but less consistent informal systems and then re-encoding to formal can identify new consistency.
3. Formal systems can be used to induce coherence in informal systems, accelerating the search for new formal coherence.
4. Both logic and metalanguage can naturally emerge by generalizing logical dependence and stripping away semantics
5. If a self-model is exposed, the metalanguage capability implies self-programming capability.
