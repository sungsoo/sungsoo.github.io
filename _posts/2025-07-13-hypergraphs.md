## Abstract

In this talk, AIDAKA LLC's Founder and CEO, Eric Neumann, discusses the use of hypergraphs in knowledge representation and ontologies. Neumann presents the challenges of aligning different ontologies and the potential benefits of hypergraphs as an intermediary for semantic integration. He also highlights the difficulties of interpreting hypergraphs and the potential for using RDF and named graphs to achieve similar results. 

The speaker links the utilization of hypergraphs, when integrated with the concept of shapes as standardized in SHACL, to effectively represent the emerging characteristics of biological data. This approach facilitates the incorporation of multi-step processes and intricate inference methods, all guided by the underlying data. 

The talk highlights the importance of efficient indexing for hypergraphs and their applications in various domains, including biology and finance.
