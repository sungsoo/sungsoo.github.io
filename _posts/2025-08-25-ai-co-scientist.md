# [Google's AI Co-Scientist Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ZqPELgYQA)

## Abstract

In this talk @BuzzRobot guest Anil Palepu explores @Google's AI co-scientist - a multi-agent system powered by Gemini 2.0 to accelerate scientific discovery through the generation and evolution of novel research hypotheses.

Inspired by the scientific method, the system follows a “generate, debate, and evolve” approach, significantly accelerated by an asynchronous task execution framework that allows for efficient test-time compute scaling.

Although the system has broad applications, early development and testing have focused on key biomedical areas like drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and uncovering mechanisms behind bacterial evolution and antimicrobial resistance.
