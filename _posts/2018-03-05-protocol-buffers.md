# An Introduction to Protobufs

## What are protocol buffers?

Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data â€“ think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler. You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the "old" format.

In the following Protocol Buffers Tutorial, Ten Loh goes into what protobufs are, how they are structured and the benefits they have as compared to standard data formats such as JSON and XML. After the brief introduction into their advantages and uses, Ten dives into why they have recently gained attention and how hackers and mobile scrapers are intercepting the data and using them to decrypt the inner workings of a popular game.
