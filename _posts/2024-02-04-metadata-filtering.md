# Enhancing Vector Database Queries with Metadata Filtering


## Abstract

Join us on January 31st for our first live session of the year! Data Scientist Ryan Siegler will present on optimizing vector similarity search using metadata filtering. The presentation will cover aspects of data exploration and metadata filtering including:

- Data Exploration with PandasAI
- Types of filtering operators
- Improvement to vector search accuracy (RAG optimization method)
- Increased vector search speed
- Time-based metadata filtering
- Auto-Retrieval / Self Query Retrieval

The presentation will include a code walkthrough, for hands on tips in metadata filtering with vector databases. Sign up today!
