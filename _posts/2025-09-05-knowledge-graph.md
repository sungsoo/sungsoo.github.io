# [The Knowledge Graph Mullet: Trimming GraphRAG Complexity - William Lyon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av2BWdd0JWI)

## Abstract

There are typically two approaches to working with graphs: property graphs and RDF. These systems are often thought of as different knowledge graph paradigms optimized for different workflows. This talk examines how combining property graph interfaces with RDF triple storage creates an optimal foundation for GraphRAG systems. We'll show how to build and use knowledge graphs using the Dgraph graph database and how knowledge graphs are the foundation of building AI Agents.
