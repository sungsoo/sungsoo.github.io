## 📈 Trends in Scientific LLM Publications
![arxiv_llms](assets/trend.png)
Cumulative trend of publications on major preprint platforms whose titles or abstracts mention the keyword “language model” or the combination “language model + scientific domain” (e.g., chemistry, physics, multi-omics, medicine, etc.). Left: Results from January 2018 to August 2025, from arXiv and PubMed. For arXiv, the matching includes “language model” in combination with additional science-related keywords; PubMed results are limited to occurrences in titles and abstracts. Both platforms show rapid growth. Right: Results from 2020 to August 2025, from bioRxiv, medRxiv, and ChemRxiv, all based on direct matches of “language model” in titles and abstracts. While the overall volumes are smaller than arXiv and PubMed, all three platforms, especially bioRxiv, show rapid acceleration, reflecting growing interdisciplinary interest in large language models across biomedical, chemical, and computational sciences

## 🔬 Development of Sci-LLMs
![sci-llm_develop](assets/sci-llms_develop.png)
Evolution of Sci-LLMs reveals four paradigm shifts from 2018 to 2025, including (1) the progression from transfer learning approaches, (2) through the scaling era marked by knowledge integration in larger models, (3) instruction-following capabilities enabling flexible task adaptation, to (4) the latest paradigm introduces scientific agents—AI systems capable of autonomously conducting scientific research, from hypothesis generation and experimental design to data analysis and discovery. Note: Model positions reflect their release dates (x-axis) rather than strict paradigm classification. The four paradigms represent evolving trends in Sci-LLM development with overlaps and continuities, not mutually exclusive categories.

## 🕑 Timeline of Sci-LLMs
![sci-llms](assets/sci-llms.png)
Chronological overview of notable Sci-LLMs categorized by six scientific domains, spanning from 2019 through early 2025. Due to the rapid expansion of the field, this figure presents a selective overview.
