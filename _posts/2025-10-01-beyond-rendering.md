# [Beyond Rendering - Why Graphics Are Needed For Physical AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p44Y3ECxjuo)


## Abstract

As machines begin to operate autonomously in the physical world — from robotics to autonomous vehicles to industrial systems — they need not only perception but understanding. NVIDIA Cosmos WFMs enable developers to build world models that can predict future states, transfer knowledge across domains, and reason about outcomes. In this hero talk, we dive deep into Cosmos Predict, Cosmos Transfer, and Cosmos Reason.

### About NVIDIA Omniverse:
