Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
==============================

A [work breakdown
structure](http://www.matchware.com/en/products/mindview/mindview2_be/wbs.htm?utm_campaign=wbs&utm_source=en-home-to-wbs-page&utm_medium=link)
is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into
manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge
([PMBOK](work-breakdown-structure-according-to-pmbok.php)) defines the
work breakdown structure as a "deliverable oriented hierarchical
decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team." The work
breakdown structure visually defines the scope into manageable chunks
that a project team can understand, as each level of the work breakdown
structure provides further definition and detail. Figure 1(below)
depicts a sample work breakdown structure with three levels defined.

An easy way to think about a work breakdown structure is as an outline
or map of the specific project. A work breakdown structure starts with
the project as the top level deliverable and is further decomposed into
sub-deliverables using the following outline hierarchy (Figure 2):

Deliverable](http://www.workbreakdownstructure.com/img-content/WBS-levels.png)

The project team creates the project work breakdown structure by
identifying the major functional deliverables and subdividing those
deliverables into smaller systems and sub-deliverables. These
sub-deliverables are further decomposed until a single person can be
assigned. At this level, the specific work packages required to produce
the sub- deliverable are identified and grouped together. The work
package represents the list of tasks or "to-dos" to produce the specific
unit of work. If you've seen detailed project schedules, then you'll
recognize the tasks under the work package as the "stuff" people need to
complete by a specific time and within a specific level of effort.

From a cost perspective, these work packages are usually grouped and
assigned to a specific department to produce the work. These
departments, or cost accounts, are defined in an organizational
breakdown structure and are allocated a budget to produce the specific
deliverables. By integrating the cost accounts from the organizational
breakdown structure and the project's work breakdown structure, the
entire organization can track financial progress in addition to project
performance.

Why use a Work Breakdown Structure?
-----------------------------------

The work breakdown structure has a number of benefits in addition to
defining and organizing the project work. A project budget can be
allocated to the top levels of the work breakdown structure, and
department budgets can be quickly calculated based on the each project's
work breakdown structure. By allocating time and cost estimates to
specific sections of the work breakdown structure, a project schedule
and budget can be quickly developed. As the project executes, specific
sections of the work breakdown structure can be tracked to identify
project cost performance and identify issues and problem areas in the
project organization. For more information about Time allocation, see
the [100% Rule](100-percent-rule-work-breakdown-structure.php).

Project work breakdown structures can also be used to identify potential
risks in a given project. If a work breakdown structure has a branch
that is not well defined then it represents a scope definition risk.
These risks should be tracked in a project log and reviewed as the
project executes. By integrating the work breakdown structure with an
organizational breakdown structure, the project manager can also
identify communication points and formulate a communication plan across
the project organization.

When a project is falling behind, referring the work breakdown structure
will quickly identify the major deliverables impacted by a failing work
package or late sub- deliverable. The work breakdown structure can also
be color coded to represent sub- deliverable status. Assigning colors of
red for late, yellow for at risk, green for on-target, and blue for
completed deliverables is an effective way to produce a heat-map of
project progress and draw management's attention to key areas of the
work breakdown structure.

Work Breakdown Structure Guidelines
-----------------------------------

The following guidelines should be considered when creating a work
breakdown structure:

-   The top level represents the final deliverable or project
-   Sub-deliverables contain work packages that are assigned to a
    organization’s department or unit
-   All elements of the work breakdown structure don’t need to be
    defined to the same level
-   The work package defines the work, duration, and costs for the tasks
    required to produce the sub-deliverable
-   Work packages should not exceed 10 days of duration
-   Work packages should be independent of other work packages in the
    work breakdown structure
-   Work packages are unique and should not be duplicated across the
    work breakdown structure

Tools to Create a Work Breakdown Structure
------------------------------------------

[Creating a Work Breakdown
Structure](how-to-make-a-work-breakdown-structure.php) is a team effort
and is the culmination of multiple inputs and perspectives for the given
project. One effective technique is to organize a brainstorming session
with the various departments that will be involved with the project.
Project teams can use low-technology tools like a white board, note
cards, or sticky note pads to identify major deliverables,
sub-deliverables, and specific work packages. These cards can be taped
to a wall and reorganized as the team discusses the major deliverables
and work packages involved in the project.

The low-technology approach is easy to do; however, it does not work
well with distributed teams or translate easily into an electronic
format. There are several tools available that support mind mapping,
brainstorming, and work breakdown structures. MatchWare MindView is an
easy-to-use [mind mapping
software](http://www.matchware.com/en/products/mindview/default.htm?utm_campaign=wbs&utm_source=en-home-to-mindview-page&utm_medium=link)
package that supports [work breakdown
structures](http://www.matchware.com/en/products/mindview/mindview2_be/wbs.htm?utm_campaign=wbs&utm_source=en-home-to-wbs-page&utm_medium=link),
project outlines, [Gantt
charts](http://www.matchware.com/en/products/mindview/mindview2_be/gantt.htm?utm_campaign=wbs&utm_source=en-home-to-gantt-page&utm_medium=link),
and exports easily into Microsoft Project for further schedule
definition. Figure 3 provides an example of a work breakdown structure
using Matchware MindView.

The key benefit to MatchWare MindView is its ease-of-use translating
work breakdown structures into high level project schedules. A natural
extension of the work breakdown structure is the project schedule. By
brainstorming the project scope in a mind mapping tool, the project
manager can easily assign budget and duration estimates. These budget
and duration estimates can easily be exported into Microsoft Excel or
Microsoft Project for additional planning and analysis. Project managers
want tools that help accelerate their work and reduce the administrative
burden that accompanies project management processes.
