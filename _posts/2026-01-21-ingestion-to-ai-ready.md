## Abstract
As the promise of AI captivates the world, the reality for many development teams is a complex and fragmented data landscape. Billions of dollars are being invested, yet most AI projects fail to meet expectations because they lack a strong data foundation. Join Snowflake's Chris Child (VP, Product Management) and Vino Duraisamy (Senior Developer Advoate) for the BUILD Day 3 Keynote addressing the core challenges holding back organizations: managing complex multimodal data, controlling costs, and adapting to a rapid pace of change. You’ll get a look at the latest developments focused on data engineering work to work with multimodal data, create flexible and adaptable data architectures, use AI not just build it, and collaborate on code and data projects. Join us for an hour of insight into the latest features you can get your hands on today.
