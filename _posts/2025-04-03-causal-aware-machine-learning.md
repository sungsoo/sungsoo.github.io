## Abstract

To go beyond the human level of intelligence, there is a need to develop new methods that combine machine learning predictive capability by better explaining the causal reasoning behind the decisions and predictions. The ML models in the causal direction are much more robust and secure in comparison to the anti-causal direction. The need for a huge amount of training data can be decreased by discovering the underlying causal structure.
