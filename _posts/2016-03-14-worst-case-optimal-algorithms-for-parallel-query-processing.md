# Worst-Case Optimal Algorithms for Parallel Query Processing

## Abstract

In this paper, we study the communication complexity for the problem of computing a conjunctive query on a large database in a parallel setting with *p* servers. In contrast to previous work, where upper and lower bounds on the communication were specified for particular structures of data (either data without skew, or data with specific types of skew), in this work we focus on worst-case analysis of the communication cost. The goal is to find *worst-case optimal parallel algorithms*.
