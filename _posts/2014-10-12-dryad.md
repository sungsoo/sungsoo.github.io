Overview
========

*New!* Dryad and DryadLINQ are now available in source form at the
[Dryad GitHub
repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftResearchSVC/Dryad), with
pre-built binaries available from [NuGet.org](http://nuget.org/). For
release documentation see our [Getting Started with
DryadLINQ](http://microsoftresearchsvc.github.io/Dryad/?topic=html/4a617e67-0920-46e4-9223-5effbac46b3d.htm)
page.

Most of the information below is historical and will be updated over
time and migrated to the [DryadLINQ
documentation](http://microsoftresearchsvc.github.io/Dryad/) site.

Dryad is an infrastructure which allows a programmer to use the
resources of a computer cluster or a data center for running
data-parallel programs. A Dryad programmer can use thousands of
machines, each of them with multiple processors or cores, without
knowing anything about concurrent programming.

The Structure of Dryad Jobs
===========================


A Dryad programmer writes several sequential programs and connects them
using one-way channels. The computation is structured as a directed
graph: programs are graph vertices, while the channels are graph edges.
A Dryad job is a graph generator which can synthesize any directed
acyclic graph. These graphs can even change during execution, in
response to important events in the computation.

Dryad is quite expressive. It completely subsumes other computation
frameworks, such as Google's map-reduce, or the relational algebra.
Moreover, Dryad handles job creation and management, resource
management, job monitoring and visualization, fault tolerance,
re-execution, scheduling, and accounting.

The Dryad Software Stack
========================

As a proof of Dryad's versatility, a rich software ecosystem has been
built on top Dryad:

-   [SSIS](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/intro2is.mspx)
    on Dryad executes many instances of SQL server, each in a separate
    Dryad vertex, taking advantage of Dryad's fault tolerance and
    scheduling. This system is currently deployed in a live production
    system as part of one of [Microsoft's
    AdCenter](http://advertising.microsoft.com/microsoft-adcenter) log
    processing pipelines.
-   [DryadLINQ](/en-us/projects/dryadlinq/default.aspx) generates Dryad
    computations from the
    [LINQ](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa904594.aspx)
    Language-Integrated Query extensions to C\#.
-   The distributed shell is a generalization of the pipe concept from
    the Unix shell in three ways. If Unix pipes allow the construction
    of one-dimensional (1-D) process structures, the distributed shell
    allows the programmer to build 2-D structures in a scripting
    language. The distributed shell generalizes Unix pipes in three
    ways:
    1.  It allows processes to easily connect multiple file descriptors
        of each process -- hence the 2-D aspect.
    2.  It allows the construction of pipes spanning multiple machines,
        across a cluster.
    3.  It *virtualizes* the pipelines, allowing the execution of
        pipelines with many more processes than available machines, by
        time-multiplexing processors and buffering results.
-   Several languages are compiled to distributed shell processes. PSQL
    is an early version, recently replaced with Scope.
