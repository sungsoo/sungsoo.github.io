# CIOs and the Ongoing Data Persistence Struggle

MemSQL ([www.memsql.com](http://www.memsql.com)), the leader in real-time databases for transactions and analytics, today announced a new Gartner report -- "Five Data Persistence Dilemmas That Will Keep CIOs Up at Night" -- that outlines the evolution of HTAP using in-memory processing, the shortcomings of NoSQL DBMSs and the importance of cloud deployments.

**Report: CIOs and the Ongoing Data Persistence Struggle** 

The report aligns with the MemSQL mission of helping enterprises move toward real-time data pipelines that can ingest, serve and query data simultaneously. The company's in-memory, distributed approach provides the highest performance for demanding workloads and enables cost-effective, horizontal scale-out both on-premises or in the cloud.

According to Gartner, CIOs are faced with three major "Impacts" that affect the way their companies approach big data. These include:

* The convergence of transaction and analytic database systems in *hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) systems* that use in-memory processing reduces the need for separate dedicated environments and shortens the time to value for new data, but it requires IT Leaders to make process compromises and changes to applications to maximize ROI.


* NoSQL DBMSs compromise a priori data models and strong levels of consistency to offer IT leaders *high-throughput* operations and *scale-out* architectures.


* Agile deployment approaches like cloud computing will present new opportunities that IT leaders and line-of-business heads must seize.


> "The Gartner report provides a compelling argument around the evolving data persistence landscape and how it's shaping the way enterprises can adopt new technologies without affecting core business processes," said Eric Frenkiel, co-founder and CEO of MemSQL. 

> "Their analysis and recommendations validate our own mission in building a database that trumps legacy solutions, address today's enterprise data challenges, and helps companies achieve their goals to become real-time enterprises."
