# Principle 3: Productivity and quality are inseparable

There is a clear relationship between productivity (measured by numbers of widgets - wheter they be lines of code or function points - per person-month) and quality. 
The *higher* the demand for *quality*, the *lower* your *productivity* becomes. 
The *more* you emphasize increased *productivity*, the *lower* your resulting *quality*.

Bell Labs has found that, to achieve one to two bugs per thousand lines of code, productivities of 150 to 300 lines of code per person-month are common  [see Fleckenstein, W., "Challenges in Software Development", *IEEE Computer*, 16, 3 (March 1983), pp. 60-64]. 
As attempts are made to drive productivity up, the density of bugs increases.
