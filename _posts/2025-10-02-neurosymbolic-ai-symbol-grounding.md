# [The Hardest Challenge in Neurosymbolic AI: Symbol Grounding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOIx08Wflqc)


## Abstract

While ML models can provide excellent results from a statistical sense, their errors cause issues when model output is used as input into a symbolic system.  For example, a small error in getting a handwritten digit wrong can lead to catastrophic failure.  The key issue is converting perceptual input into symbols part of a "symbol system".  Researchers have studied this problem since the 1990's and it has become more relevant in AI with the increased popularity of neurosymbolic approaches.
