# The Frontier of Deep Learning for Robotics

## Abstract
Today's robots excel at performing very specific tasks within a narrow and controlled environment. But, when faced with a novel situation, their highly specialized training doesn’t enable them to adjust on the fly. In the future, could robots learn to adapt to new tasks they haven’t been trained to do?

One possible solution to this problem is deep learning. While deep learning is expanding the capabilities of both machine learning and reinforcement learning, it also has the potential to unleash new possibilities for robotics. Join Professor Chelsea Finn in this discussion of modern deep reinforcement learning algorithms, and learn more about their usefulness towards solving ambitious challenges in robotics.
