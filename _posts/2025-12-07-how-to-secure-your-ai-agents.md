# [How to secure your AI Agents: A Technical Deep-dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZXvqEqJT7o)

## Abstract

AI agents introduce unique security challenges like prompt injection, data leakage, and excessive agency. This workshop breaks down the OWASP LLM Top 10 and demonstrates how to implement robust security controls using Model Armor and the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Learn how to filter malicious inputs, redact sensitive data from outputs, and manage authentication patterns to build secure and reliable agentic workflows.
