(Adapted from the University Libraries; permission to use provided by the Libraries’ HR Office)


*This checklist will provide information on what you should do before, during, and after a performance review meeting. Some general tips are also provided to aid in a successful performance review process.*


## Before the Meeting

- Review your Job Responsibilities Worksheet, performance standards, and Development Action Plan.

- Write and submit accomplishments and self-assessment (Staff Input) and return to your supervisor. 

- Draft a Development Action Plan and return to your supervisor.

## During the Meeting
- Share information regarding your accomplishments, interests, goals, and resources and training needs.


- Work with your supervisor to reach consensus on the performance review


- Sign the Performance Review.


- Discuss ideas for next year’s development action plan and any changes to the Job Responsibilities Worksheet.

- Plan for follow-up meeting to review and sign your new Development Action Plan and, if applicable, revised desk job description.

## After the Meeting

- Obtain copies of signed Staff Input, Performance Review, and Development Action Plan from supervisor. 

- Implement the Development Action Plan. Refer to it throughout the year and revise, as needed, based on
changing department goals and priorities.

## General Tips

- During the review meeting, if there are areas of performance identified as needing improvement; ask for specific examples to clarify the issues if your supervisor hasn’t provided any. Make suggestions on how you can improve in the area.

- If you have been in one position for many years and feel that there has been little change in your job, you may have difficulty setting goals for the coming year. Keep in mind that year-to-year there are changes in technology, department restructuring, changes in work distribution, and other things that cause changes in how a job is performed. Try to develop goals that target keeping up with these changes or the changing goals of the department or University goals and initiatives. Longer-term professional development goals may also be something that can be discussed with your supervisor.
