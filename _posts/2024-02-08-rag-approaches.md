# Overview of RAG Approaches with Vector Databases


## Abstract

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a fast-moving practice to extend the knowledge of your LLMs to private and real-time data. In the past few weeks and months, different approaches have been constructed by developers around the world, including:

- Naive RAG
- Agent Assisted RAG
- Guardrails RAG
- Knowledge Graph RAG
- Time Based RAG

These often use LangChain or LlamaIndex with a vector database to create useful conversational apps.

Join this session as we discuss different approaches to RAG, as well as optimizing RAG with structured retrieval, chunk decoupling, and more.
