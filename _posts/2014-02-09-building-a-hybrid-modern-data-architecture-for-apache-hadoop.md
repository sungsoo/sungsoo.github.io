---

This webinar shows the power of combining the Hortonworks Data Platform with Microsoftâ€™s ubiquitous Windows, Office, SQL Server, Parallel Data Warehouse, and Azure platform to build the Modern Data Architecture for Big Data. 

* Building a hybrid Modern Data Architecture using Hadoop within a Microsoft Windows or Azure (cloud) environment

* How to seamlessly combine your traditional data warehouse with the new world of Hadoop (by leveraging an integrated query model)

* How to leverage your existing Microsoft properties such as Windows, System Center, SQL Server, Parallel Data Warehouse, Excel to integrate with Hadoop

* How to leverage Excel and Power BI for Office 365 to gain insights over both your relational data and your Hadoop data from within the familiar Microsoft Office suite
