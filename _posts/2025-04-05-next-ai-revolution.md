## Abstract

Join Turing Award laureate Yann LeCun—Chief AI Scientist at Meta and Professor at NYU—as he discusses the future of artificial intelligence and how open-source development is driving innovation. In this wide-ranging conversation, LeCun explains why AI systems won’t “take over” but will instead serve as empowering assistants. He highlights key challenges in AI research, including the need for common-sense reasoning, persistent memory, and more advanced architectures that go beyond today’s large language models. LeCun also shares why open-source foundation models are critical for ensuring broad access, diversity, and democratic values in an AI-driven world. Filmed at Davos, this talk offers an exciting glimpse of what the next few years of AI breakthroughs may bring—from new possibilities in robotics to transforming the way we interact with technology every day.
