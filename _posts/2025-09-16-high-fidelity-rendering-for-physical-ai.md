# [High-Fidelity Rendering for Physical AI With NVIDIA Omniverse RTX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaUNeP_wV18)

## Abstract

Building and validating intelligent agents and digital twins for complex real-world operations demands physically accurate, real-time simulation. NVIDIA Omniverse RTX provides this crucial fidelity, fundamentally transforming how Physical AI is developed. This session explores the capabilities of Omniverse RTX, powered by NVIDIA RTX Pro hardware, enabling critical workflows: generating diverse synthetic sensor data for AI training and performing real-time multi-sensor closed-loop simulation (cameras, LiDAR, radar). Discover how these accessible rendering and sensor simulation capabilities empower you to develop cutting-edge intelligent systems.
