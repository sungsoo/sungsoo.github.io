# When to use Kubernetes natively over Kubeflow for ML

The ZenML Meet The Community event happens every week on Wednesdays 9AM PT / 5 PM CEST (Register here: https://www.eventbrite.de/e/zenml-mee.... While the main goal of the meeting is to chat between each other about latest features and bugs, the ZenML core team sometimes does a demo of new features. Therefore, we sporadically record these meetings and share with a wider audience. 

The last meeting was a chance to showcase the latest #Kubernetes native orchestrator for the first time. The Kubernetes orchestrator is to be used as a light-weight alternative to more heavy duty orchestrators like #Airflow or #Kubeflow.
