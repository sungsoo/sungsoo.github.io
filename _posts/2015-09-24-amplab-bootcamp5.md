# AMP Camp 6

AMP Camp 6 will be held in Berkeley, California on November 19 and 20, 2015. Participants will get hands-on experience with data analytics and machine learning using the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS), the set of open-source projects including Spark, SparkR, GraphX, Tachyon and MLlib/MLbase that interoperate with, and are part of, the Hadoop ecosystem.

Hands-on exercises will span both days of the event. Attendees will run the exercises on their own laptops using the provided USB drives with the BDAS software already installed. A team of graduate students, including the lead developers of the BDAS software projects, will be present to act as Teaching Assistants. They will answer questions, solve issues on the fly, and explain in detail how the software works.

In addition to existing BDAS software projects, AMP Camp 6 will contain talks previewing bleeding edge research happening in the AMPLab.

The event will be held in the Chevron Auditorium in the [International House at UC Berkeley](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/6/#local-information)
