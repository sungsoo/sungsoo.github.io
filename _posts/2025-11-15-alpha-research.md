## Abstract

This paper introduces AlphaResearch, an autonomous research agent leveraging large language models (LLMs) to discover new algorithms for open-ended problems. It proposes a novel dual research environment combining execution-based verification with a simulated real-world peer-review system. AlphaResearch iteratively generates ideas, verifies them, and optimizes proposals. The paper also presents AlphaResearchComp, a new benchmark of eight open-ended algorithmic problems, showing AlphaResearch achieving best-of-known performance on one problem ('packing circles') and a 2/8 win rate against human researchers, demonstrating LLMs' potential in accelerating algorithm discovery.
