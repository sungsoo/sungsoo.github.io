# [What Leaders Need to Understand About AI with Nobel Laureate Geoffrey Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32f9MgnLSn4)

## Abstract

What's the most overused word when it comes to AI? According to Geoffrey Hinton, one of the inventors of the modern LLM, it's hype and AI is under, not overhyped. He explains the power of AI coaches and assistants in healthcare, education, and the workplaces and what leaders most need to understand about the technology.

### Speaker

Since keynoting Valence's first AI & the Workforce Summit in 2024, Geoffrey Hinton has been an informal advisor to our leadership team. Known as the "Godfather of AI," Geoffrey Hinton laid the foundations for the field of deep learning as a researcher at the University of Toronto. A visionary computer scientist, he nurtured a generation of AI innovators who now lead top tech companies and research institutions worldwide. He received a Turing Award in 2018, for his work on deep learning, and a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2024, for "foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks."
