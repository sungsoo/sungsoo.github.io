# IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering

## Submit a Manuscript

## Submitting a paper to *TKDE*

To Submit your paper, please use **[ScholarOne
Manuscripts](https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/tkde-cs)**.

Detailed information on submitting your paper to *TKDE* can be found in
the Authors tab of the **[IEEE Computer Society Journal Peer
Review](/web/peer-review/journals)** page.

The full scope of *TKDE* can be found on [*TKDE*'s about
page](/web/tkde/about)

## Manuscript types accepted by *TKDE*

*TKDE* manuscript types and submission length guidelines are as follows:

-   Regular paper – 14 double column pages *(Note: All regular paper
    page limits include references and author biographies)*
-   Concise paper – 6 double column pages
-   Comments paper – 2 double column pages
-   Survey paper – 20 double column pages (Note: All survey paper page
    limits include references and author biographies)

Please note that double column will translate more readily into the
final publication format. A double column page is defined as a 7.875" x
10.75" page with 10-point type, 12-point vertical spacing, and 1/2 inch
margins. A single column page is defined as an 8.5" x 11" page with
12-point type and 24-point vertical spacing, containing approximately
250 words. All margins should be one inch (top, bottom, right and left).
These length limits are taking into account reasonably-sized figures and
references.

## Open access

This publication is a hybrid journal, allowing either Traditional
manuscript submission or Open Access (author-pays OA) manuscript
submission.

The OA option, if selected, enables unrestricted public access to the
article via IEEE Xplore. The OA option will be offered to the author at
the time the manuscript is submitted. If selected, the OA discounted fee
of \$1,750 must be paid before the article is published in the journal.
If you have unusual circumstances about this, please contact the
Editor-in-Chief. Any other applicable charges (such as the over-length
page charge and/or charge for the use of color in the print format) will
be billed separately once the manuscript formatting is complete but
prior to the publication.

The traditional option, if selected, enables access to all qualified
subscribers and purchasers via IEEE Xplore. No OA payment is required.
