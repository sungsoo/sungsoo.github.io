# The Next Wave of AI - Physical AI

## Abstract

Advancements in accelerated computing and physics-based simulation, have led us to the next frontier of AI: Physical AI. 

Physical AI models can perceive, understand, interact and navigate the physical world with generative AI.  This new frontier of AI manifests itself through the embodiment of physical systems that go beyond a traditional AMR, robot arm or humanoid robot and instead, include everything from streetlights to data centers, healthcare facilities and manufacturing plants. With Physical AI, static systems will transform from static systems to dynamic, responsive systems. 

To enable developers to build physical AI, NVIDIA has built 3 computers. NVIDIA AI and DGX to train foundation models, @NVIDIAOmniverse to simulate and enhance AIs in a physically-based virtual environment, and the NVIDIA Jetson AGX, a robot supercomputer. 

The era of physical AI is here - transforming the world's heavy industries and robotics. Join the world’s leading companies and get started with NVIDIA Robotics now. 

Learn more about the three computers enabling physical AI and the foray into humanoid robots.
