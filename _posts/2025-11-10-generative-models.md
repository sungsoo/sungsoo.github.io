# [Synthetic Data: Generative AI for Enhanced Data Quality in the Era of Foundational Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiPffkyGrs)

## Abstract

A thought-provoking session that explores the transformative potential of synthetic data in the age of foundational language models. As Language Models (LMs) like GPT-3 and its successors continue to reshape the landscape of AI, the quality of training data becomes paramount. This session will deep dives into the synergy between synthetic data and foundational models exploring the impact of data quality in foundational models, the role of synthetic data, data augmentation, bias and data privacy.
