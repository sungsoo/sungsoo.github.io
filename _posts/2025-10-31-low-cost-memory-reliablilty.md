* Managing Memory

DRAM scaling has been the prime driver for increasing the capacity of main memory systems. Unfortunately, scaling DRAM to smaller technology nodes is challenging due to the inherent difficulty in designing smaller geometries, device variation, and leakage. Furthermore, devices start to exhibit new failure modes, such as Rowhammer and Row-Press that can be exploited by attackers to take control of the system. In this talk, we will discuss low-cost memory reliability solutions that can tolerate scaling-faults, runtime faults and the new failure modes.
