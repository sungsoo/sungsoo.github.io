## Abstract

SciAgent is a unified, hierarchical multi-agent AI system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning, enabling adaptability across diverse disciplines and difficulty levels. It features a Coordinator Agent for global task understanding and routing, specialized Worker Systems for domain-specific reasoning, and Sub-agents for execution. The system dynamically assembles and refines reasoning pipelines through feedback loops, achieving gold-medal-level performance in Mathematics and Physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO) and demonstrating strong generalization on IChO and Humanity's Last Exam benchmarks. This work establishes a concrete step towards AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

### Key Topics:
