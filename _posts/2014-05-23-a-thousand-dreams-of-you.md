Oh It's time to dream,

a thousand dreams of you!

It's been so grand

together,yes together.

It thrilled me from the start,

You brought the spring again.

Your finger touched

the string of my heart

and made it sing again.

I hope you dream,

a thousand dreams of me.

All things we're planed

doing together.

And if you do ,

I dream my whole life through.

A thousand,

a million,

a zillion dreams of you.

all right.

I hope you dream,

a thousand dreams of me.

All things we're planed

doing together.

What was prominsed to do something together.

And if you do ,

I dream my whole life through.

A thousand,

a million,

a zillion dreams of you.
