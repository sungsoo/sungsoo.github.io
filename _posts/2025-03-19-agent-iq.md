# How to Develop Teams of AI Agents with NVIDIA AgentIQ

## Abstract

NVIDIA AgentIQ is an open-source library for connecting, evaluating, and accelerating teams of AI agents. The AgentIQ toolkit simplifies development while optimizing and increasing the accuracy of full-stack, complex agentic AI systems. 

In this demo, we show you how to use the NVIDIA AgentIQ Python library designed to enable enterprise developers to build agentic AI applications by bringing the other components from different large language model frameworks or inventing components themselves. These large language model frameworks might be LangChain or Llama Index, CrewAI, or Semantic Kernel â€” or many others.
