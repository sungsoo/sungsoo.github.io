# [Introduction to Logic (for AI)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfo6KgBplZo) 

## Abstract

The Neuro Symbolic Channel provides the tutorials, courses, and research results on one of the most exciting areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  With content originally from the AI course taught at Arizona State University, this channel brings you the latest at the intersection of symbolic methods (e.g., logic programming) and deep learning.  Learn about the latest algorithms, Python packages, and progress toward larger goals such as artificial general intelligence (AGI).

#### In this video:
This video provides a quick primer on logic in the propositional case.  Covers classic logic syntax and world-based semantics.

Lecture by Paulo Shakarian, Arizona State University.

## [Inference in propositional logic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyZ8Nl3D4M0)

The Neuro Symbolic Channel provides the tutorials, courses, and research results on one of the most exciting areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  With content originally from the AI course taught at Arizona State University, this channel brings you the latest at the intersection of symbolic methods (e.g., logic programming) and deep learning.  Learn about the latest algorithms, Python packages, and progress toward larger goals such as artificial general intelligence (AGI).

#### In this video:
This video provides a quick primer on inference in propositional logic, includes discussion of how lattice theory (i.e., the use of a fixpoint operator) can be used to answer entailment queries.  Useful concepts for those looking to study logic programming or knowledge and reasoning (KR).

## [Tutorial: First Order Logic (FOL, Predicate Calculus)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSyt_P_40-M)


This video provides a quick primer on first order logic (FOL, predicate calculus).  Here we discuss predicates, constants, variables, grounding, etc.  This is a key concept in knowledge and reasoning (KR), logic programming (LP), and knowledge graph reasoning.  Topics include constant, predicate, and variable symbols, universal and existential quantification, grounding, and graphical representations of FOL.
