# HCatalog Integration

Apache Tajo™ catalog supports HCatalogStore driver to integrate with Apache Hive™. This integration allows Tajo to access all tables used in Apache Hive. Depending on your purpose, you can execute either SQL queries or HiveQL queries on the same tables managed in Apache Hive.

In order to use this feature, you need to build Tajo with a specified maven profile and then add some configs into conf/tajo-env.sh and conf/catalog-site.xml. This section describes how to setup HCatalog integration. This instruction would take no more than ten minutes.

First, you need to compile the source code with hcatalog profile. Currently, Tajo supports hcatalog-0.11.0 and hcatalog-0.12.0 profile. So, if you want to use Hive 0.11.0, you need to set -Phcatalog-0.11.0 as the maven profile

	$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdist -Dtar -Phcatalog-0.11.0

Or, if you want to use Hive 0.12.0, you need to set -Phcatalog-0.12.0 as the maven profile

	$ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pdist -Dtar -Phcatalog-0.12.0
	
Then, you need to set your Hive home directory to the environment variable HIVE_HOME in conf/tajo-env.sh as follows:

	export HIVE_HOME=/path/to/your/hive/directory
	
If you need to use jdbc to connect HiveMetaStore, you have to prepare MySQL jdbc driver. Next, you should set the path of MySQL JDBC driver jar file to the environment variable HIVE_JDBC_DRIVER_DIR in conf/tajo-env.sh as follows:

	export HIVE_JDBC_DRIVER_DIR==/path/to/your/mysql_jdbc_driver/mysql-connector-java-x.x.x-bin.jar

Finally, you should specify HCatalogStore as Tajo catalog driver class in conf/catalog-site.xml as follows:

```xml
<property>
  <name>tajo.catalog.store.class</name>
  <value>org.apache.tajo.catalog.store.HCatalogStore</value>
</property>
```
