# Chunking Best Practices for RAG Applications


## Abstract

Join our livestream chat on Chunking Best Practices for Retrieval Augmented Generation. In this session, Data Scientist Ryan Siegler will overview how to choose the best chunk size and different chunking methods, including:

- Naive Chunking
- Structural Chunkers
- Summarization
- Extraction
- and Multi-Modal Chunking

As we observe increasing context windows for LLMs, surfacing the most relevant information to the LLM will still yield you the best results. Come learn how to optimize your RAG pipelines with these chunking tips.
