# Mega-KV: A Case for GPUs to Maximize the Throughput of In-Memory Key-Value Stores

## Abstract

*In-memory key-value stores* play a critical role in data processing to provide high throughput and low latency data accesses. In-memory key-value stores have several unique properties that include (1) *data intensive operations* demanding high memory bandwidth for fast data accesses, (2) *high data parallelism* and *simple computing operations* demanding many slim parallel computing units, and (3) a *large working set*. As data volume continues to increase, our experiments show that conventional and general-purpose multicore systems are increasingly mismatched to the special properties of key-value stores because they do not provide massive data parallelism and high memory bandwidth; the powerful but the limited number of computing cores do not satisfy the demand of the unique data processing task; and the cache hierarchy may not well benefit to the large working set. 

In this paper, we make a strong case for GPUs to serve as special-purpose devices to greatly accelerate the operations of in-memory key-value stores. Specifically, we present the design and implementation of **Mega-KV**, a *GPU-based in-memory key-value store system* that achieves high performance and high throughput. Effectively utilizing the high memory bandwidth and latency hiding capability of GPUs, Mega-KV provides fast data accesses and significantly boosts overall performance. Running on a commodity PC installed with two CPUs and two GPUs, Mega-KV can process up to 160+ million key-value operations per second, which is 1.4-2.8 times as fast as the state-of-the-art key-value store system on a conventional CPU-based platform.
