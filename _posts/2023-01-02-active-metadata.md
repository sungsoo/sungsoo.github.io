# How Atlan and Unity Catalog Power Column-Level Lineage and Active Metadata

## Abstract

"What does this mean? Who created it? How is it being used? Is it up to date?" Ever fielded these types of questions about your Databricks assets? 

Today, context is a huge challenge for data teams. Everyone wants to use your company's data, but often only a few experts know all of its tribal knowledge and context. The result — they get bombarded with endless questions and requests. 

Atlan — the active metadata platform for modern data teams, recently named a Leader in The Forrester Wave: Enterprise Data Catalogs for DataOps — has launched an integration with Databricks Unity Catalog. By connecting to UC’s REST API, Atlan extracts metadata from Databricks clusters and workspaces, generates column-level lineage, and pairs it with metadata from the rest of your data assets to create true end-to-end lineage and visibility across your data stack.

In this session, Prukalpa Sankar (Co-Founder at Atlan and a lifelong data practitioner) and Todd Greenstein (Product Manager with Databricks) will do a live product demo to show how Atlan and Databricks work together to power modern data governance, cataloging, and collaboration.
