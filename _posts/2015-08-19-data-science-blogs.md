# Top 50 Data Science Resources
## The Best Blogs, Forums, Videos and Tutorials to Learn All about Data Science


The field of data science is constantly evolving and ever-advancing,
with new technologies placing more valuable insights in the hands of
modern enterprises. More data-driven organizations are hiring data
scientists to drive their efforts to gather, analyze, and make use of
Big Data in valuable ways.

Because the field of data science is so broad and sometimes challenging
to navigate, we’ve compiled a list of 50 of the most helpful data
science resources on the web. Whether you’re a student or new
professional working in the field of data science, these resources are
valuable for discovering the latest employment opportunities, finding
tutorials for the processes and systems you’re using on a daily basis,
learning hacks and tricks to boost your performance, and connecting with
other professionals in your field.

FastML is “meant to tackle interesting topics in machine learning while
being entertaining and easy to read and understand.” Run by Zygmunt
Zając, FastML was born from a frustration with papers and documentation
that aren’t easily understood by the average user who lacks both the
time and interest in becoming a PhD-level expert in every machine
learning topic. In other words, FastML breaks down technical material in
an easy-to-understand manner.
