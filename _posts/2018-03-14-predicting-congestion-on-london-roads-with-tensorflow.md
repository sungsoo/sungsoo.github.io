# Predicting congestion on London's roads with TensorFlow

## Abstract

Predicting *congestion* is an important part of any traffic management system. With accurate *forecasting traffic* can be effectively regulated, ensuring safe and fast journeys on the roads. Based on data from Transport for London (TfL) we trained a neural network in TensorFlow that predicts congestion in south-west London. With this use case as example we will demonstrate how TensorFlow can be used to build predictive models for *time series data*.

## Traffic Jam Prediction

The percentage turns into red if a traffic jam is in progress. It turns back into blue once the road starts clearing.
