# [Agent Bricks: Build a Multi-Agent GenAI System in Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMyeg0wMXwU)

## Abstract
In this hands-on demo, see how Agent Bricks makes it easy to build high-quality, production-ready AI agents—without wrangling infrastructure or writing complex code.

We’ll walk through how to:

* Build a knowledge assistant for an R&D team to query PDFs of energy drink formulas
* Evaluate performance automatically using MLflow traces and custom metrics
* Improve answers with natural language feedback using agent learning—no retraining needed
* Orchestrate expert agents from multiple departments (R&D, marketing, finance) into a multi-agent supervisor that can answer your CEO’s toughest questions, like “What flavor should we launch next?”

You’ll learn how to unify unstructured data, automate evaluation, and streamline agent tuning—all from a simple declarative interface.
