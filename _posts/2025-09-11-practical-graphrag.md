# [Practical GraphRAG: Making LLMs smarter with Knowledge Graphs — Michael, Jesus, and Stephen, Neo4j](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQ1xTTdPlQg)


## Abstract

RAG has become one standard architecture component for GenAI applications to address hallucinations and integrate factual knowledge. While vector search over text is common, knowledge graphs represent a proven advancement by leveraging advanced RAG patterns to access and integrate interconnected factual information, complementing the language skills of LLMs. This talk explores GraphRAG challenges, implementation patterns, and real-world agentic examples with Google's ADK, demonstrating how this approach delivers more trustworthy and explainable GenAI solutions with enhanced reasoning capabilities.
