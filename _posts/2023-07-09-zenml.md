# MLOps Pipeline Tutorial with ZenML and Kubeflow


We're back people! We just spent the last few months of 2021 redesigning and implementing ZenML, and are ready to showcase it to the world! 

ZenML is a framework to create reproducible, production-ready #machinelearning #pipelines. It is built for #datascientists to transition their models from a local experimental setup to a robust modern #mlops infrastructure in production. 

In this walkthrough, Hamza goes through a simple tutorial on how to create a training pipeline, run it locally, and then deploy it to a local #kubeflow based stack.
