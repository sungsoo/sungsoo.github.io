# Automated Data Lineage with Unity Catalog

## Abstract

Unity Catalog automatically tracks data lineage for all workloads in SQL, R, Python, and Scala. Data lineage is captured down to the table and column level and displayed in real time with just a few clicks. Unity Catalog also captures lineage for other data assets such as notebooks, workflows, and dashboards. Lineage can be retrieved via REST API to support integrations with other data catalogs and governance tools.
