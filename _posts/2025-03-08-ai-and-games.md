# Future of AI and Games


## Abstract
Julian Togelius is an associate professor at New York University, U.S., and a co-founder of modl.ai, which recently raised $8.4M to develop AI-driven playtesting and QA bots. Julian's research is on artificial intelligence and games, with goals such as making games more fun, easier to design and develop, more adaptive, or just enabling games and interactive experiences that we cannot yet create. He is interested in all kinds of games that people play: video games, board games, card games or mind games. Julian has written numerous scientific articles and also two books on AI and games.
