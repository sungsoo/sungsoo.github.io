# Activate Your Metadata to Empower Innovation

## Abstract

Over the last 20 years, the number of systems companies use has been on the rise, especially in the areas of big data, AI, and ML technologies. More systems, along with their connections, maintenance, and testing, result in higher costs. To navigate the data chaos, companies need to activate their metadata and obtain a full map of their data environment to understand it. At this lecture, you will learn:

* What active metadata is and why it is the future of data maintenance.
* How to activate your metadata to solve the growing pain and costs caused by the increasing pace of changes, the growing data landscape, and the need for innovation
