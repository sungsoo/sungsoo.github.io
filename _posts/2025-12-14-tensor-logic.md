# [Tensor Logic "Unifies" AI Paradigms [Pedro Domingos]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APMGvicmxY)


## Abstract

Pedro Domingos, author of the bestselling book "The Master Algorithm," introduces his latest work: Tensor Logic - a new programming language he believes could become the fundamental language for artificial intelligence.

Think of it like this: Physics found its language in calculus. Circuit design found its language in Boolean logic. Pedro argues that AI has been missing its language - until now.
