Research skills
===============

Writing papers, giving research talks, and writing research proposals
are key skills, but they aren't easy. This page describes how I approach
each of these three challenges, in the hope that they may be useful to
you.

You probably have ideas of your own. Can you share them with other
readers of this page? Here's a **[Wiki
page](http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simonpj/Talk:ResearchSkills)** that
anyone can edit, where you can add your comments on the presentations
below, your own thoughts and suggestions, and pointers to other material
you have found useful.

Here is a [version of this page, translated into
Russian](http://science.eduboard.com/research-skills).

How to give a good research talk

John Hughes, SIGPLAN Notices 28(11), Nov 1993.

    talk](http://www.wit.at/events/peyton-jones/giving_a_talk.ram) at

Since we wrote the paper quite a few people have written with
[constructive comments](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk-comments.html). Nick Nethercote
also has a [useful 2-page
guide](http://www.valgrind.org/njn/good-talk.html) about giving a talk.

How to write a good research paper
----------------------------------

"How to write a good research paper", Simon Peyton Jones.

I gave this talk at the Technical University of Vienna in October 2004.
There isn't a paper about it, only the talk:

-   Powerpoint slides of the talk: [Zipped PPT
    (400k)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper.zip) or [PDF
    (850k)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-paper-slides.pdf).
-   [Video of the talk](http://sms.cam.ac.uk/media/1464870) (34 mins)
    which I gave at the Cambridge Computer Lab, Spring 2013, with huge
    thanks to Neil Dodgson for the editing and production.
-   [Another video, much much older. Needs RealPlayer
    v10.](http://www.wit.at/events/peyton-jones/writing_a_paper.ram)

How to write a good research proposal
-------------------------------------

"How to write a good research proposal", Simon Peyton Jones and Alan
Bundy.

-   A web page giving [general advice about writing research
    proposals](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/Proposal.html).
-   Powerpoint slides of a talk on the subject, given in Moscow, April
    2006: [Zipped PPT (115k)](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/writing-a-proposal.zip)

Other resources
---------------

Finally, here are some pointers to other advice I have found useful,
though Google will find you a lot more besides.

-   [The Navigators Research Book of
    Style](http://www.navigators.di.fc.ul.pt/wiki/The_Navigators_Research_Book_of_Style)
    is a slide deck from the Navigators research group at the University
    of Lisbon. It covers choosing a research topic, doing research, and
    writing and submitting a paper.
-   [Research tips](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~silvia/research-tips/)
    (including how to do research, how to write and present a paper, how
    to design a poster, how to review, etc), by [Sylvia
    Miksch](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~silvia/)
-   [Notes on presenting
    theses](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/research_students/theses.php),
    edited by Aaron Sloman, gives useful guidelines and ideas for PhD
    students writing their thesis.
-   [Chris O'Leary's essays about writing an "elevator
    pitch"](http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com). This stuff,
    especially the list of attributes in the "Elevator pitch 101" page,
    is very relevant to writing a good grant proposal.
-   [Guide for preparation and publication of abstracts](prepguide.djvu)
    and [A scrutiny of the abstract](scrutiny.djvu), both by Kenneth
    Landes in Geological Notes. These short notes give guidance about
    writing the abstract of your paper. (Both require a DjVu viewer
    which you can get from [LizardTech](http://www.lizardtech.com).)
-   Norman Ramsey's notes about his [class on Technical
    Writing](http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/pubs/two-abstract.html).
-   [Mathematical
    Writing](http://tex.loria.fr/typographie/mathwriting.pdf), by Donald
    E. Knuth et al. The first three sections constitute a minicourse on
    technical writing: only eight pages long. The time to read it will
    repay itself many times over.
-   [How to Write
    Mathematics](http://www.stat.rice.edu/~riedi/Halmos.html), by PR
    Halmos.
-   Gian-Carlo Rota's excellent talk [Ten lessons I wish I had been
    taught](http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~cahn/life/gian-carlo-rota-10-lessons.html),
    which, among other things, has a bit to say about giving a talk.
-   David Patterson's talk [How to have a bad career in
    research/academia](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~pattrsn/talks/nontech.html)
    has many wise things to say on a related topic.
-   [Mark Leone's
    page](http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html)
    has a good collection of links to other resources.
-   Papers about measurement:
    -   [Producing wrong data without doing anything obviously
        wrong!](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1508244.1508275)
        Mytkowicz, Diwan, Hauswirth and Sweeney, ASPLOS 2009.
    -   [How not to lie with statistics - the correct way to summarise
        benchmark
        results](http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=5666.5673&coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&CFID=106744944&CFTOKEN=90490737)
        Fleming & Wallace, CACM 29(3), pp218-221, March 1986.
