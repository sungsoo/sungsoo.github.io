# Generative Modeling


## Abstract

Kaiming He, Associate Professor in MIT's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and member of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, gives a talk on generative modeling.

He's talk was part of Deep Learning Day for the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing's Expanding Horizons in Computing series. Organized by MIT faculty, the series comprised of four sessions that delved into key topics in computing — deep learning, societal impact, cryptography and security, and quantum technology.
