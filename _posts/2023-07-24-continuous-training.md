## Abstract

In this video, we use ZenML to build a continuous training and deployment (CD/CT) #machinelearning pipeline using the Seldon Core integration. The video is brought to you by @Ed Shee from Seldon, and is actually a recording of a Community Hour hosted by Seldon to showcase this integration.
