# [Beyond AI Agents: The Future of Enterprise AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0SauDeWVUk)


## Abstract

AI is transforming faster than leaders can rewrite their strategies, and staying ahead requires a new kind of clarity. 
In this episode of Gartner ThinkCast, Gartner Director Analyst Deepak Seth joins to explore what’s next in AI implementation, including what comes after AI agents. 
He’ll break down where AI really sits on the Gartner Hype Cycle today, why organizations struggle to operationalize new capabilities, and how leaders can stay grounded while still planning for a rapidly shifting future.

### You'll learn:
* How to overcome the most common implementation pitfalls
* Why value from AI is a journey, not an overnight return
* How to make forward-looking decisions without falling into "wait and see" paralysis
* Why AI agents won’t define the long-term future of enterprise AI
* What bold predictions could reshape the next decade
