# Huge Language Models and Neuro-Symbolic AI

## Abstract

The term “neuro-symbolic AI” evokes heated debates, with neutal-net-diehards on one extreme, neuro-skeptics on the other, and the rest trying to have a rational conversation. We had a rational conversation, in the context of natural language.

Yoav Shoham is a professor emeritus of computer science at Stanford University. A leading AI expert, Prof. Shoham is Fellow of AAAI, ACM, and the Game Theory Society. Among his awards are the IJCAI Research Excellence Award, the AAAI/ACM Allen Newell Award, and the ACM/SIGAI Autonomous Agents Research Award. His online Game Theory course has been watched by close to a million people. Prof. Shoham has founded several AI companies, including TradingDynamics (acquired by Ariba), Katango and Timeful (both acquired by Google), and AI21 Labs. Prof. Shoham also founded the AI Index initiative (www.AIindex.org), which tracks global AI activity and progress.
