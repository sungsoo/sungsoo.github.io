# Distributed Computing Conferences 


The conferences listed here are major conferences of the area; they have
been selected using the following criteria:

1.  the notability of the conference has been confirmed by multiple
    independent sources; for example, it has been mentioned in textbooks
    [<span>[</span>1<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-lynch-1)[<span>[</span>2<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-tel-2)[<span>[</span>3<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-georgiou-3)
    or other
    sources,[<span>[</span>4<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-podc-mailinglist-4)[<span>[</span>5<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-wattenhofer-5)
    or it has received a high ranking
    [<span>[</span>6<span>]</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_distributed_computing_conferences#cite_note-core-6)
2.  the conference focuses on distributed and parallel computing
    (instead of having a much broader scope such as algorithms in
    general)
3.  the conference covers a reasonably large part of the fields of
    distributed and parallel computing (instead of focusing on a narrow
    sub-topic).

For the first criterion, references are provided; criteria 2–3 are
usually clear from the name of the conference.
