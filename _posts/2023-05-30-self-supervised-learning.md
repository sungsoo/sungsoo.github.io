# Self-Supervised Learning; Self-Prediction and Contrastive Learning


## Abstract
In the world of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning is a game-changing technique for training models using unlabelled data. Self-prediction and contrastive learning are two popular methods of self-supervised learning that have been successful in various applications, such as image and speech recognition.

In this video, we will dive deep into the concepts of self-supervised learning, self-prediction, and contrastive learning. We will explain how these techniques work, and explore their advantages over traditional supervised learning methods.

You will learn about the key components of self-supervised learning, such as pretext tasks and feature extraction, and see how they enable models to learn from unlabelled data. We will also provide examples of real-world applications of self-supervised learning, including the popular BERT model for natural language processing.

So, whether you are a beginner in AI or an experienced practitioner, this video will provide you with valuable insights into the world of self-supervised learning.
