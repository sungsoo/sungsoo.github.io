# [AI Co Scientist: How GPT 5 Solved Unsolved Math Problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUx9qAEyIFE)


## Abstract

What happens when GPT-5 stops being just a chatbot and starts acting like an AI Co-Scientist? 🚀

In this 13:30 deep dive, we unpack how early science acceleration experiments with GPT-5 helped:

Solve a decades-old Erdős Problem #848 in combinatorial number theory

Decode a T-cell mystery via N-linked glycosylation interference and mannose rescue

Reveal hidden black hole symmetries in the Kerr metric

Compress fusion simulations from months to hours with ridge maps and clever scaffolding

You’ll learn:

What an AI Co-Scientist actually is (and why it’s more than a “smart intern”)

How scaffolding, warm-up exercises, and expert oversight turn GPT-5 into a reasoning engine

Why “negative space” reasoning helps prune dead-end proofs and integrals

How deep literature search lets GPT-5 connect obscure papers across decades and disciplines

Where hallucinations become dangerous vs. where they spark useful hypotheses

Practical prompts like “simulation over speculation” and “what am I missing?” for your own research workflows

If you’re a researcher, engineer, or builder who wants to work with frontier models instead of just chatting with them, this is your roadmap to using an AI Co-Scientist today.
