# RAMCloud

## What is RAMCloud? 

RAMCloud is a new class of storage for large-scale datacenter
applications. It is a key-value store that keeps all data in DRAM at all
times (it is not a cache like memcached). Furthermore, it takes
advantage of high-speed networking such as Infiniband or 10Gb Ethernet
to provide very high performance. Applications running in the same
datacenter as a RAMCloud cluster can access small objects in about 5μs,
which is1000x faster than disk-based storage systems. Small writes take
about 15μs. At the same time, RAMCloud storage is durable: data is
automatically replicated on nonvolatile secondary storage such as disk
or flash, so it is not lost when servers crash. One of RAMCloud's unique
features is that it recovers very quickly from server crashes (only 1-2
seconds) so the availability gaps after crashes are almost unnoticeable.
Finally, RAMCloud is designed to scale: it can support clusters
containing thousands of storage servers, with total capacities up to a
few petabytes.

From a practical standpoint, RAMCloud enables a new class of
applications that manipulate large data sets very intensively. Using
RAMCloud, an application can combine tens of thousands of items of data
in real time to provide instantaneous responses to user requests. 
Unlike traditional databases, RAMCloud scales to support very large
applications, while still providing a high level of consistency. We
believe that RAMCloud, or something like it, will become the primary
storage system for structured data in cloud computing environments such
as Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure. We have built the system not as a
research prototype, but as a production-quality software system,
suitable for use by real applications.

RAMCloud is also interesting from a research standpoint. Its two most
important attributes are latency and scale. The first goal is to provide
the lowest possible end-to-end latency for applications accessing the
system from within the same datacenter. We currently achieve latencies
of around 5μs for reads and 15μs for writes, but hope to improve these
in the future. In addition, the system must scale, since no single
machine can store enough DRAM to meet the needs of large-scale
applications. We have designed RAMCloud to support at least 10,000
storage servers; the system must automatically manage all the
information across the servers, so that clients do not need to deal with
any distributed systems issues. The combination of latency and scale
creates a large number of interesting research issues. To date we have
addressed several of these, such as how to ensure data durability
without sacrificing the latency of reads and writes, how to take
advantage of the scale of the system to recover very quickly after
crashes, and how to manage storage in DRAM. Many more issues remain,
such as whether we can provide higher-level features such as secondary
indexes and multiple-object transactions without sacrificing the latency
or scalability of the system. We are currently exploring several of
these issues.

The RAMCloud project is based in the Department of Computer Science at
Stanford University.

begins) but they may still provide useful background information as well
