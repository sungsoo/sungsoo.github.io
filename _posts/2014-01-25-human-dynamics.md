Human Dynamics
---

**Human Dynamics** is a *transdisciplinary research* field focusing on the understanding of dynamic patterns, relationships, narratives, changes, and transitions of human activities, behaviors, and communications. Human dynamics is a branch of *complex systems research* in statistical physics. Its main goal is to understand *human behavior* using methods originally developed in *statistical physics*. Research in this area started to gain momentum in 2005 after the publication of A.-L. Barabási's seminal paper The origin of bursts and heavy tails in human dynamics.[1] that introduced a *queuing model* that was alleged to be capable of explaining the *long tailed distribution* of inter event times that naturally occur in human activity.

This paper spurred a burst of activity in this new area leading to not only further theoretical development of the **Barabasi model**,[2][3][4] it's experimental verification in several different activities[5] and the beginning of interest in using proxy tools, such as web server logs.[6][7][8] , cell phone records[9][10] and even the rate at which registration to a major international conference occurs[6] and the distance and rate people around the globe commute from home to work.[11]

In recent years there has been a growing appetite for access to new data sources[12] that might prove useful in quantifying and understanding human behavior on a collective scale.
