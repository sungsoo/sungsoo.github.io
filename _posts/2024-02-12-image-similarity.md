# Image Similarity Search with Vector Databases


## Abstract

In this session, we will demonstrate how vector databases can be used to find similar images to a given query image. This can be used in a variety of industrial applications such as finding manufacturing defects, facial/object recognition, radiological scans, and more.

In this particular session, we will be doing a hands-on walkthrough of how MRI scans can be used to identify potential healthy and unhealthy patients based on brain scans. You can simply watch the session, or follow along hands-on by signing up for KDB.AI at https://kdb.ai before the session.

Hope to see you there!
