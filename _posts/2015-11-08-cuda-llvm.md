# CUDA LLVM Compiler

NVIDIA's CUDA Compiler (NVCC) is based on the widely
used [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) open source compiler infrastructure.
Developers can create or extend programming languages with support for
GPU acceleration using the *NVIDIA Compiler SDK*.

Add GPU Acceleration To Your Language
-------------------------------------

![](https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/cuda/images/LLVM_Compiler_structure.jpg)

You can add support for GPU acceleration to a new or existing language
by creating a language-specific frontend that compiles your language to
the internal representation (IR) used by LLVM. Many [language frontends
already exist.](http://llvm.org/ProjectsWithLLVM/)

The IR generated by your front end is then optimized for execution on
your target device. You can add support for a new device by developing a
processor-specific backend which will perform the final compilation on
the optimized LLVM IR.

NVIDIA has worked with the LLVM organization to contribute the CUDA
compiler source code changes to the LLVM core and parallel thread
execution backend, enabling full support of NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA Compiler SDK
-------------------

The SDK contains documentation, examples and tested binaries to get you
started on your own GPU accelerated compiler project.

The following components of the NVIDIA Compiler SDK are shipped as part
of the latest [CUDA Toolkit Installer](/cuda-downloads):

-   An optimizing compiler library (libnvvm.so,
    nvvm.dll/nvvm.lib, libnvvm.dylib) and its header file nvvm.h are
    provided for compiler developers who want to generate PTX from a
    program written in NVVM IR, which is a compiler internal
    representation based on LLVM.
-   A set of libraries, libdevice.\*.bc, that implement the common math
    functions for devices in the LLVM bitcode format.
-   A set of samples that illustrate the use of the compiler SDK.
-   Documents for the Compiler SDK (including the specification for LLVM
    IR, an API document for libnvvm, and an API document for libdevice),
    can be found under the doc sub-directory, or
    [online](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html#compiler-sdk).
-   The optimizing compiler libraries, the lidevice libraries and
    samples can be found under the **nvvm** sub-directory, seen after
    the CUDA Toolkit Install.

More libNVVM examples are provided at
[GitHub](https://github.com/nvidia-compiler-sdk)

Getting Support
---------------

-   NVIDIA registered developers can file bugs via the [CUDA Registered
    Developer Program](/joining-cuda-registered-developer-program)
-   Support is also available for all developers on our
    developer forums.

Source Availability
-------------------

NVIDIA has contributed key enhancements to the LLVM project to enable
support of CUDA and massively parallel accelerators such as GPUs. Source
is available from the[LLVM Project Home Site](http://llvm.org).
