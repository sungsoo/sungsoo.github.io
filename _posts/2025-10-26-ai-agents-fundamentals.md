## Abstract

🧪AI Agents Labs for Free: [https://kode.wiki/3Wh4DZ6](https://kode.wiki/3Wh4DZ6)

Learn everything about AI agents from scratch in this comprehensive tutorial. No prior knowledge required. We'll take you from zero to building production-ready AI systems with hands-on labs.

🎯 What You'll Learn:

* AI Fundamentals - LLMs, tokens, embeddings, and context windows
* LangChain - Simplify AI development with pre-built components
* Prompt Engineering - Zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought techniques
* Vector Databases - Semantic search with ChromaDB and Pinecone
* RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - Build intelligent document search
* LangGraph - Create multi-step AI workflows and agents
* MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Connect AI to external tools

🔧 Hands-On Labs Include:

* Making your first OpenAI API calls
* Building semantic search engines
* Creating RAG systems for document retrieval
* Developing multi-agent workflows
* Integrating external tools with MCP
