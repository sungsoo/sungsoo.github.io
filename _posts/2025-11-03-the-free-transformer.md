# [[Paper Analysis] The Free Transformer (and some Variational Autoencoder stuff)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nao16-6l6dQ)

## Abstract

We propose an extension of the decoder Transformer that conditions its generative process on random latent variables which are learned without supervision thanks to a variational procedure. Experimental evaluations show that allowing such a conditioning translates into substantial improvements on downstream tasks.
