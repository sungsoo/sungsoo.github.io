# [The non-technical PM's guide to building with Cursor - Zevi Arnovitz (Meta)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1em64iUFt3U)

## Abstract
Zevi Arnovitz is a product manager at Meta with no technical background who has figured out how to build and ship real products using AI. His engineering team at Meta asks him to teach them how he does what he does. In this episode, Zevi breaks down his complete AI workflow that allows non-technical people to build sophisticated products with Cursor.

### We discuss:

1. The complete AI workflow that lets non-technical people build real products in Cursor
2. How to use multiple AI models for different tasks (Claude for planning, Gemini for UI)
3. Using slash commands to automate prompts
4. Zevi’s “peer review” technique, which uses different AI models to review each other’s code
5. Why this might be the best time to be a junior in tech, despite the challenging job market
6. How Zevi used AI to prepare for his Meta PM interviews
