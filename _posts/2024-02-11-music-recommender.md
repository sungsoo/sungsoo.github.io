# Building a Music Recommender with Vector Databases


## Abstract

Continuing on our weekly interactive livestream, for this session, Data Scientist Nathan Crone, will show how to use KDB.AI to build a music recommendation system using a vector database powered by similarity search.

Feel free to watch along or jump into the action yourself by signing up for a free KDB.AI Cloud Starter Edition account before the session at https://kdb.ai

In this session, we'll walk through a hands-on example of building applications on vector databases. You'll learn the basics of vector databases and how they can be used in the real world.
