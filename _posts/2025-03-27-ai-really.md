## Abstract

A lot of us have heard conjectures around A.I., edge cases of the positive and negative side of A.I., and a lot of us are trying to predict what’s next. Most of my understanding of A.I. comes only from viewing what is apparent today.. reinforcement learning spaces like chat gpt becoming a go-to.. 

In this episode of People by WTF, we uncover the basics of this mystery of artificial intelligence with one of the founding fathers of A.I., Yann LeCun. We spoke about popular AI myths and broke down complex concepts that can perhaps help the next generation of builders build in this space. 

To learn more about Machine Learning, we’ve collated some sources for your benefit and growth in this industry.
