## Abstract

Why is Reinforcement Learning (RL) suddenly everywhere, and is it truly effective? Have LLMs hit a plateau in terms of intelligence and capabilities, or is RL the breakthrough they need?

In this workshop, we'll dive into the fundamentals of RL, what makes a good reward function, and how RL can help create agents.

We'll also talk about kernels, are they still worth your time and what you should focus on. And finally, weâ€™ll explore how LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 can be quantized down to 1.58-bits and still perform well, along with techniques to maintain accuracy.
