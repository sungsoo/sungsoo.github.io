## Abstract

This paper introduces EditThinker, a framework designed to enhance instruction-based image editing by implementing a "Think-while-Edit" paradigm. Addressing the limitations of single-turn editing models which often act as reactive executors, EditThinker employs a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to mimic human deliberation through an iterative cycle of critiquing results and refining instructions. The authors construct a large-scale dataset, THINKEDIT-140k, and utilize reinforcement learning to align the model's reasoning with practical editing outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the instruction-following capabilities of various state-of-the-art image editors without requiring fine-tuning of the editors themselves.

### Key Topics:

* Image Editing
* Iterative Reasoning
* Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM)
* Reinforcement Learning
