# [Introducing serverless reinforcement learning: Train reliable AI agents without worrying about GPUs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecSfrcQZbI)


## Abstract

Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most effective ways to fine-tune an AI agent for reliability, speed, and cost-effectiveness. Until now, getting started meant spending hours or days evaluating GPU providers and wiring up scripts and infrastructure. With our launch of the industry’s first Serverless RL, that’s changed. In this video, we’ll introduce the new capabilities and show you how to get your RL training job running in minutes without thinking about GPUs.
