### Agile Processes: Scrum
### Introduction

* The two dominant Agile approaches are Scrum and *eXtreme Programming* (XP).
* XP was arguably the first method deemed to be “**Agile**”.  
* We will start with **Scrum** – very popular and in very wide use today!

### Project Management Emphasis based on a Standard 30-day Sprint
* **Scrum**: a definite project management emphasis.

* **Scrum Master**:  A Scrum project Is managed by a Scrum Master, who can be considered as much a consultant or coach as a manager.

* **Sprint**:  Scrum has a fundamental 30-day development cycle called a Sprint, preceded by pre-Sprint activities and post-Sprint activities.

* **Daily Scrum**:  A short (less than 30 minutes) daily Scrum Meeting allows the team to monitor status and communicate problems.

### Product Backlog for Planning
* **Project planning** is based on a **Product Backlog**, which contains
	* *functions* and 
	* *technology* enhancements 
* envisioned for the project.

* Two meetings are held – 
	* one to decide the *features for the next Sprint* and 
	* the other to *plan out the work*.

### Scrum and Scalability
* **Scrum**: one of the few *agile methods* used to *scale up* for larger projects.
* How done?
	* Accomplished the *same way* as organizations handle integrated product teams.
	* *Individual Scrum team coaches* - part of a higher echelon team of coaches spanning several products.
	* This provides for communications to avoid conflicting development issues  
	
### Scrum - Queues

* Product Backlog -> Sprint Backlog -> Sprint -> Working increment of the Software

* **Scrum** uses *lightweight queue-based management* and *work-breakdown mechanisms*.

* **Product Backlog queue**:  a low-tech customer-managed queue of demand requests for products.

* **Sprint**:  At launch time, a Sprint (30-day time-boxed iteration) does *just-in-time planning* 

* **Sprint Backlog**: queue for Sprint work-management.

### Scrum - Management
 
* **Daily Scrum**:  Very notable and very visible
* Is a **daily standup**, 
	* *except* that it is the *team* that is participating and sharing coordination information *not a central project manager*.

* **Scrum Master**
	* holds daily scrum and acts more as a *facilitator* and *runs interference* for the core team when **blocks** or **issues** arise.  (Kennaley, SDLC 3.0, p. 31)
