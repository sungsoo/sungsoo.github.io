# Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Networks

## Abstract

*Representation learning over graph structured data* has been mostly studied in static graph settings while efforts for modeling dynamic graphs are still scant. In this paper, we develop a novel *hierarchical variational model* that introduces additional latent random variables to jointly model the hidden states of a *graph recurrent neural network* (GRNN) to capture both topology and node attribute changes in dynamic graphs. We argue that the use of high-level latent random variables in this *variational GRNN* (VGRNN) can better capture potential variability observed in dynamic graphs as well as the uncertainty of node latent representation. With semi-implicit variational inference developed for this new VGRNN architecture (SI-VGRNN), we show that flexible non-Gaussian latent representations can further help dynamic graph analytic tasks. Our experiments with multiple real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that SI-VGRNN and VGRNN consistently outperform the existing baseline and state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin in dynamic link prediction.
