# Programing Should Be More Than Coding

Leslie Lamport is best known for his seminal work in distributed systems, and as the initial developer of the document preparation system LaTeX and the author of its first manual. Leslie Lamport was the winner of the 2013 Turing Award for imposing clear, well-defined coherence on the seemingly chaotic behavior of distributed computing systems, in which several autonomous computers communicate with each other by passing messages. 

In this video Lamport speaks about the key differences between a programmer and a coder. The talk was recorded at the 7th Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF).
