A More Beautiful Question 
=========================

An average four year old girl in Britain asks around **390**
**questions** a day. But as we age we stop asking questions. This is
evident from the chart given below. Our reading and writing skills went
up but our questioning skills went down a lot. In the excellent book [A
More Beautiful
Question](http://www.amazon.com/More-Beautiful-Question-Inquiry-Breakthrough/dp/1620401452)
– Warren Berger explains why questions are more important than answers
and how to improve our questioning skills.


Why do we stop questioning?
---------------------------

In order to question we need to **think**. This requires some mental
workload. Our brain tries to find ways to reduce this workload. One way
to reduce the workload is to not question and accept everything around
us and operate in an autopilot mode. Psychologist Daniel Kahneman refers
to this as
[System1](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/06/04/association/ "Association")
thinking.

In order to question we need to accept our **ignorance**. But our
society punishes ignorance by labeling the ignorant as an idiot. Since
the
[incentives](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/incentives/ "Incentives")
are not aligned we stop asking questions.

In order to question we need to remain **curious**. Fear is the enemy of
curiosity. In schools most kids see teachers as
[authority](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/05/24/authority/ "Authority")
figures and this fear prevents them from asking questions. When we grow
up we continue this behavior by following the instructions from the
higher ups blindly.

Questions are valuable than answers
-----------------------------------

Someone asked Albert Einstein for his phone number. Einstein looked up
for his own number in the phone book. When asked why a genius like him
cannot remember his own number, he replied – there’s no reason to fill
his mind with information that can easily be looked up. This is very
true In the current era of **Google** and **Watson**.

I wanted to know the price of IBM stock. I did a google search by typing
IBM and it already figured out what I was looking for and it autofilled
IBM stock in the results.

In 2011 IBM Watson made its appearance on the TV quiz show named
Jeopardy. It proved to the world that it can answer questions better
than any human. It is a treat to see Watson playing against the humans.

As the world becomes more complex and dynamic **knowledge** is becoming
a **commodity**. Answers are available everywhere. We cannot compete
with technology in storing answers. But when it comes to questioning we
have the edge. Computers does not know how to ask questions. We humans
have curiosity, creativity, divergent thinking skills, imagination, and
judgement. To use this effectively we need to ask questions. If we think
of questions and answers as stocks, the value of questions are going up
and answers are coming down.

Given below are simple questions asked by normal people like you and me
which resulted in creating huge impacts.

Marc Benioff, an executive at the tech company Oracle once asked –
“**Why aren’t all enterprise software applications built like Amazon and
eBay?**” – The result is [salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/).
As of today its market capitalization is \$35 billion.

Tim Westergren, a musician once asked – “**What if a radio station could
know what songs you would like before you knew?**” – The result is
[Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/). It plays music according the tastes
of each member.

Nanda, a design student at MIT once asked – “**What if it was harder to
turn off the alarm clock? What if your alarm clock forced you to get out
of bed and chase after it?**” – The result is
[clocky](http://www.nandahome.com/). Unlike other clocks that you can
easily hit the snooze button and fall back asleep, the Clocky Alarm
Clock makes sure you get out of bed.

Why-What If-How
---------------

Albert Einstein once said – 

> If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. 

He spends a lot of time to come up with the right question to
ask. Finding out the right question to ask is very difficult. It is a
skill one has to develop by practicing. Warren Berger calls this right
question as a most beautiful question.

> **A** **beautiful** **question** is an ambitious yet actionable
> question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about
> something – and that might serve as a catalyst to bring about change.

Just coming up with questions without taking any action will not produce
any change. **Questions + Actions = Innovation**. On the other hand
**Questions – Actions = Philosophy**. In order to ask questions that
produces change he proposes a framework called as **Why-What If-How**.

1.  **Why** – Person encounters a situation that is less than ideal and
    asks why.
2.  **What If** – Person begins to come up with ideas for possible
    improvements and solutions – with such ideas usually surfacing in
    the form of what If possibilities.
3.  **How** – Person takes one of those possibilities and tries to
    implement it or make it real; this mostly involves figuring out how.

Let us apply this **Why-What If-How **framework to a real example.

At the age of 13, [Jack
Andraka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka) lost his uncle due
to pancreatic cancer. Upon researching in the internet he found out over
85% of pancreatic cancer are detected at the late stage. He also found
out that the technique used for detection is **(1)** Over 60 years old
**(2)** Expensive and it costs around $800 **(3)** Not reliable and
misses 30% of the times. This made him to ask the why question – **Why
isn’t there a fast, inexpensive test for pancreatic cancer?**

He started learning about cancer from his two friends – **Google** and
**Wikipedia**. From this he learned that cancer patients have high level
of a protein called mesothelin. He was thinking about ways to detect
this protein. His breakthrough came in high school biology class. He was
reading about carbon nanotubes which change electrical properties when
combined with antibodies and mesothelin. This made him to ask the what
if question – **What if I exposed a single-wall carbon nanotube with an
antibody to a protein overexposed in pancreatic cancer?**

He emailed his idea to 200 medical professors and 199 of them rejected.
A professor named Anirban Maitra thought this idea might work and he
opened up his lab for Andraka and helped him to move to the **how**
stage. After failing several times he finally solved the puzzle. His
solution was a paper sensor which **(1)** Costs 3 cents **(2)** Just 5
minutes to run **(3)** Extremely reliable.

This innovation earned him an international science fair award and an
invitation to be a special guest at President Obama’s 2013 State of the
Union address. Watch the TED presentation given by Andraka. It is simply
the best.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Charlie Munger tells that if you want to get smart you need to ask
[why](https://janav.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/why/ "Why?"). Sakichi
Toyoda, the founder of Toyota Industries invented **five whys**
methodology. In this method one should ask **why** **five times** in
succession as a means of getting to the **root** of the problem. Here is
an example from the book

> When, for example, a faulty car part came out of a factory, asking why
> the first time would yield the most obvious answer – say, that someone
> on the assembly line had made a mistake. By then asking why that
> mistake occurred, an underlying cause might surface – such as
> insufficient training on a task. Asking why again, the company might
> discover the training program was underfunded; and asking why about
> that could lead back to fundamental company priorities about where
> money should be spend and what was most important in the end.

Questioning led Andraka to develop a way to detect cancer when he was
just 15 years old. All of us have the capability to question. We are
born with that skill. Unfortunately we lost that skill due to the fear
of showing our ignorance. Take the initiative to making questioning a
habit. [A More Beautiful
Question](http://www.amazon.com/More-Beautiful-Question-Inquiry-Breakthrough/dp/1620401452) is
an excellent read and I really enjoyed it.
