# [RAG Agents in Prod: 10 Lessons We Learned — Douwe Kiela, creator of RAG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPL-6-9MVyA)


## Abstract

The latest generation of LLMs is demonstrating impressive test time reasoning capabilities.  However, to be truly valuable in an enterprise setting requires those agentic capabilities to be applied to the right enterprise data. In all the excitement around AI agents, many of us have somehow forgotten the timeless adage “garbage in; garbage out” – language models can only do their job if they are contextualized properly. In this talk, Douwe Kiela will share lessons learned from deploying enterprise RAG systems at scale and how to design a system robust enough for the Fortune 500.
