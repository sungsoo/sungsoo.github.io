# [Google Researcher Shows Life "Emerges From Code"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMSEqJ_4EBk)


## Abstract

Blaise Agüera y Arcas explores some mind-bending ideas about what intelligence and life really are—and why they might be more similar than we think (filmed at ALIFE conference, 2025 - [https://2025.alife.org/](https://2025.alife.org/)).

Life and intelligence are both fundamentally computational (he says). From the very beginning, living things have been running programs. Your DNA? It's literally a computer program, and the ribosomes in your cells are tiny universal computers building you according to those instructions.
