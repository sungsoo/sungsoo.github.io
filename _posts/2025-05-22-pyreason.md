### About the channel
The Neuro Symbolic Channel provides the tutorials, courses, and research results on one of the most exciting areas in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  With content originally from the AI course taught at Arizona State University, this channel brings you the latest at the intersection of symbolic methods (e.g., logic programming) and deep learning.  Learn about the latest algorithms, Python packages, and progress toward larger goals such as artificial general intelligence (AGI).
