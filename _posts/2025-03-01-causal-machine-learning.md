# Causal Machine Learning in Python



## Abstract

Hey future Business Scientists, welcome back to my Business Science channel. This is Learning Lab 90 where I shared how I do Causal Machine Learning and Causal Inference in Python. This FULL TUTORIAL is JAMMED to the brim with value. I cover an in-depth Python Marketing Analytics workshop that covers making Marketing Experiments, exploratory analysis with Correlation Funnels, modeling bookings and cancellations, working with statsmodels to make Logistic Regression Models, using Causal Machine Learning with Uber's CausalML, and more!
