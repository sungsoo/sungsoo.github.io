Get an under the hood look at the next frontier in Search, from the team at Google behind the technology. The Knowledge Graph is a huge collection of the people, places and things in the world and how they're connected to one another. With this technology, Google can get you the best possible answers and help jump start your discovery.

## Build a Small Knowledge Graph Part 1 of 3: Creating and Processing Linked Data

This is the first video in a 3-part series. In this video, Jarek Wilkiewicz introduces you to the reference architecture for support of Schema.org Actions (http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ) in the context of a specific use case (a music store). The video then then focuses on exposing entities using Schema.org markup with JSON-LD.

## Build a Small Knowledge Graph Part 2 of 3: Managing Graph Data With Cayley

This is the second video in a 3-part series. In this video, Barak Michener introduces you to graph processing using Cayley, an open source graph database written in Go. Cayley is fast, free, and easy to get started with. Clone it from this repository: [https://github.com/google/cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley) or try the demo dataset in a live instance running on Google App Engine: [http://cayley-graph.appspot.com/](http://cayley-graph.appspot.com/).

## Build a Small Knowledge Graph Part 3 of 3: Activating Graph Data With Actions

This is the third video in a 3-part series. In this video, Jarek Wilkiewicz builds on the previous two episodes to show you how to activate a small Knowledge Graph with Schema.org Actions ([http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ](http://goo.gl/vw8rOJ)). 

The the first video in this series ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pRp...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9pRpSW_KqA)) covers creating and processing linked data using Schema.org and JSON-LD. 

The second video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOwr...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oOwrBEeQss)) focuses on data loading and graph processing using Cayley, and open source graph database written in Go ([https://github.com/google/cayley](https://github.com/google/cayley)). 

After watching the videos you will have a solid foundation to embark upon the Google I/O 2014 Actions Codelab ([http://goo.gl/4ykgZ6](http://goo.gl/4ykgZ6)).
