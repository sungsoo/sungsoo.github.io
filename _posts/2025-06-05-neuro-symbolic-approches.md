# [Beyond the AI Divide: How Neuro-Symbolic Approaches Combine the Best of Both Worlds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_1lg1TXCOM) 

## Abstract

Recorded April 23, 2025

Hosted by Abby Covert & Larry Swanson

This conversation will explore the practical intersection of neural network approaches (LLMs/GPTs) with symbolic AI and knowledge structures (knowledge graphs and ontologies). We'll engage participants in discussing real-world experiences, challenges, and successes they've seen when these worlds collide.

### Key discussion points:

* What have you seen work (or fail) when combining traditional knowledge organization with AI?
* How are organizations balancing the flexibility of LLMs with the structure of knowledge graphs?
* Where do librarians, information architects and other knowledge workers fit in this evolving landscape?
* What practical challenges are you facing when implementing these hybrid approaches?
* How do we build teams that bridge the technical and information science disciplines?
