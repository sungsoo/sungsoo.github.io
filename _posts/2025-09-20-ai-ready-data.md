# [AI Ready Data - Forging the Path to Reliable and Scalable AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNVLfcRWbSE)


## Abstract

With the emergence of mainstream LLMs like GPT-3, Google Gemini, and DeepSeek, big models are becoming a commodity. As LLMs train on shared public datasets, companies must prioritize AI-ready data over mere OpenAI API integration to stay competitive.

This session explores how industries can achieve AI-ready data to navigate the “first-party data-pocalypse.” We’ll discuss the risks of inaction and the importance of investing in data collection and infrastructure.

What we will cover:

* Understand the current state of reliable AI in enterprise industries.
* Explore the evolving AI stack, the role of first-party data, and the foundations of data and AI observability.
* Learn the data architectures and processes for building reliable generative AI, including RAG and fine-tuning.
* Learn best practices for detecting, triaging, and resolving data incidents to ensure GenAI reliability with AI-ready data.
