# [SciSpace BioMed Agent Review - AI Co Scientist Transforming Biomedical Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K54B4NgdnXM)

## Abstract
Biomedical research is complex, fragmented, and time consuming. In this video, we take a deep dive into SciSpace BioMed Agent, an AI co scientist built specifically for biomedical workflows.

You will see how SciSpace BioMed Agent helps researchers streamline genomics, single cell analysis, CRISPR workflows, clinical variant interpretation, drug discovery, and more all inside one unified AI system. This is not just another chatbot. It is a purpose built biomedical engine that understands biology, workflows, and real research problems.

We also explore one of its most powerful features: AI generated biomedical illustrations, including publication ready pathway diagrams, mechanisms of action, and biological processes generated directly from prompts.

If you are a biomedical researcher, PhD student, clinician, or data scientist tired of switching between multiple tools, this review shows why SciSpace BioMed Agent could completely change your daily workflow.
