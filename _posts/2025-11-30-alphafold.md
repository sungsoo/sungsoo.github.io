# [AlphaFold: Grand challenge to Nobel Prize with John Jumper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pGs0btGmgY)


## Abstract

Five years ago, AlphaFold 2 solved the protein structure prediction problem, unlocking new avenues of biological research and providing our first major proof point that AI can be a powerful tool to advance science. The profound scientific and societal value of this work was even recognized in 2024 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In this episode, Hannah is joined by John Jumper, one of the most instrumental scientists behind AlphaFold. He shares stories about his Nobel win, the tool's unexpected applications, and the shift in architecture from AlphaFold 2 to the more comprehensive [AlphaFold 3](https://deepmind.google/science/alphafold/).
