Spark Documentation
-------------------

Setup instructions, programming guides, and other documentation are
available for each version of Spark below:

-   [Spark 1.0.0 (latest release)](/docs/latest/)
-   [Spark 0.9.1](/docs/0.9.1/)
-   [Spark 0.8.1](/docs/0.8.1/)
-   [Spark 0.7.3](/docs/0.7.3/)
-   [Spark 0.6.2](/docs/0.6.2/)

The documentation linked to above covers getting started with Spark, as
well the built-in components [MLlib](/docs/latest/mllib-guide.html),
[Spark Streaming](/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html), and
[GraphX](/docs/latest/graphx-guide.html).

In addition, this page lists other resources for learning Spark.

# Hands-On Exercises

-   [Hands-on exercises](http://spark-summit.org/2013/exercises/) are
    available online from Spark Summit 2013. These exercises let you
    launch a small EC2 cluster, load a dataset, and query it with Spark,
    Shark, Spark Streaming, and MLlib.

# Training Materials

-   The 2nd day of [Spark Summit 2013](http://spark-summit.org/2013) was
    a training session, and you can find the slides and videos from that
    inline in [the training day
    agenda](http://spark-summit.org/summit-2013/#agendapluginwidget-5).
    The session also included
    [exercises](http://spark-summit.org/2013/exercises/) that you can
    walk through yourself, which will guide you through launching a
    Spark cluster on EC2 and using various Spark components to analyze
    real data.
-   The [UC Berkeley AMPLab](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/) regularly
    hosts training camps on Spark and related projects. Slides, videos
    and EC2-based exercises from each of these are available online:
    -   [AMP Camp 4](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/4/) (Strata Santa
        Clara, Feb 2014) — focus on BlinkDB, MLlib, GraphX, Tachyon
    -   [AMP Camp 3](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/3/) (Berkeley, CA, Aug
        2013)
    -   [AMP Camp
        2](http://ampcamp.berkeley.edu/amp-camp-two-strata-2013/)
        (Strata Santa Clara, Feb 2013)

# Examples

-   The [Spark examples page](/examples.html) shows the basic API in
    Scala, Java and Python.

# Wiki

-   The [Spark
    wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Wiki+Homepage)
    contains information for developers, such as architecture documents
    and how to
    [contribute](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark)

# Research Papers

Spark was initially developed as a UC Berkeley research project, and
much of the design is documented in papers. The [research
page](/research.html) lists some of the original motivation and
direction. The following papers have been published about Spark and
related projects.
