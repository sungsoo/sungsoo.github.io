# Writing-up Qualitative Research

Looks at a range of issues that need thinking about when writing up qualitative research. These include: getting started, free-writing, organization – chronological, thematic etc. – focus, drop files, getting feedback, details, tightening up, style, conclusions and editing. This was a lecture given to postgraduate (graduate) students at the University of Huddersfield as part of a course on Qualitative Data Analysis.
