You're probably hearing a lot about AI, DeepSeek, NVIDIA and more right now. If you want the big picture (and to start from the beginning), watch this Huge Conversation with NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang.

In the last few years, NVIDIA has skyrocketed to become one of the world's most valuable companies. That's because, beginning in the 90s, they led a fundamental shift in how computers work, now unleashing the current explosion of what’s possible with technology.

A huge amount of the most futuristic tech you’re hearing about - in AI, robotics, gaming, self-driving cars, breakthrough medical research - relies on new chips and software designed by him and his company.

During the dozens of background interviews I did to prepare for this, what struck me most was how much Jensen Huang has already influenced all our lives over the last 30 years, and how many are saying it’s just the beginning of something even bigger…

We all need to know what he’s building and why, and most importantly, what he’s trying to build next, so you can decide for yourself what you think of it. 

Welcome to the second episode of our new series, Huge Conversations…

If you want to know what the most important people building the future are imagining it will look like, Huge Conversations is the show for you.

This interview was recorded at CES in Las Vegas on January 7th, 2025.
