## Abstract

This paper proposes Agentic Memory (AgeMem), a unified framework that enables LLM agents to autonomously manage both long-term and short-term memory through learned tool-based actions. Moving beyond separate heuristic-based components, AgeMem integrates memory operations—such as adding, updating, retrieving, summarizing, and filtering—directly into the agent's policy. To achieve this, the authors introduce a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy and a step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to handle sparse rewards. Experiments on five long-horizon benchmarks show that AgeMem significantly outperforms strong memory-augmented baselines.
